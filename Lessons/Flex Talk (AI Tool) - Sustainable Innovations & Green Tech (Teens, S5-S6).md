|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins     | Start with a quick icebreaker game called "Green Tech Bingo". Hand out bingo cards with images of different green technologies (e.g., solar panels, electric cars). Students mingle and find classmates who can explain what each technology does. The first student to complete their card shouts "Bingo!" and shares their findings with the class. This activity activates prior knowledge and builds excitement around the topic.                                                               | Ensure that the bingo cards are well-explained; some students might need additional visual aids. Encourage students to use English for their discussions and ask questions if they need clarification on any technologies.                      |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins     | Show a short video clip (2-3 minutes) showcasing innovative green technologies. Follow with an open class discussion. Prompt students with questions like "What did you find most interesting?" and "Which technology do you think is most beneficial?" This stage sets the context for the lesson and engages students with the topic emotionally and intellectually.                                                                                                                    | Use the video to introduce key vocabulary and concepts. Pause the video if necessary to point out new terms, and encourage students to share initial reactions or questions.                                                                 |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins     | Conduct an activity called "Innovation Pitch". Divide students into small groups and give each group a slip with a brief description of an innovative green technology (e.g., vertical farming, wind turbines). Groups prepare a short pitch to present to the class, explaining the advantages of their assigned technology. Each group has a task to identify and use at least three new vocabulary words. This allows practice of target language within a meaningful context.                                          | Model a sample pitch using a simple technology example. Provide sentence starters on the board to help students frame their ideas. Offer formative assessment feedback after each student presents to build confidence and clarity.             |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins     | Play a quiz game called "Green Tech Challenge". Students compete in teams to answer questions about key terms and phrases related to sustainability and green technology. Use a digital platform to display questions and track scores. This interactive game reinforces vocabulary retention and encourages peer learning.                                                                                                                           | Ensure that questions are appropriate for B1-B2 levels, mixing both easier and more challenging questions. Encourage teams to discuss answers together before responding. Provide immediate feedback to clarify misunderstandings.            |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins     | Have students prepare for a role-play activity called "Green Innovator's Forum". Each student takes on the role of an innovator presenting their invention at a sustainability convention. They use a graphic organizer to plan their speech, focusing on introducing the technology, explaining its benefits, and persuading the audience of its value. This exercise enhances structured thinking and fluency.                                                            | Provide clear examples and model organizing speeches. Use visual aids to support students in structuring their presentation. Offer guidance and feedback as students plan their roles, encouraging collaboration and creativity in their approaches. |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins     | Students participate in the "Green Innovator's Forum". They present their roles in small groups, listen to each other, and provide feedback. Encourage questions and comments from peers, fostering an authentic speaking environment. This promotes fluency, confidence, and spontaneous interaction about green technologies.                                                                                                                  | Encourage active listening by requiring students to ask at least one question after each presentation. Guide them in giving constructive feedback to peers, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement.                                    |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins     | Conduct a feedback session highlighting common errors and good language use. Use specific examples from the presentations. Address pronunciation issues, especially of challenging vocabulary. Emphasize the connection between effective communication and language accuracy. Wrap up with praise for effort and improvement areas.                                                                                           | Provide balanced feedback focusing on both language and content. Encourage students to reflect on what they learned and how they can apply it in future tasks. Make use of visual aids to demonstrate correct pronunciation and usage.           |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins      | Open floor for any remaining questions, clarifications, or further discussion points. Use this time to address any individual concerns or explore any emerging interests from students. It offers an opportunity for personalized attention to ensure full comprehension and comfort with the topic.                                                                                                                                                   | Stay flexible in this time slot to address varying student needs. Be approachable and open to all questions, reinforcing a supportive learning environment.                                                                                   |
