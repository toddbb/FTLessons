## Lesson Procedures

| Stage                     | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Warmer                    | 10 mins | Start the lesson by connecting with students through a quick ice-breaker related to their dream jobs. Each student shares their dream career in one sentence. Use this to establish rapport and to create a positive and relaxed classroom environment. Encourage students to ask follow-up questions to each other, fostering an initial peer support system. This activity not only activates prior knowledge but builds a classroom community with low-stakes speaking practice. |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins | Introduce the topic by showing images of various workplaces. Prompt students with questions about what skills might be necessary in these environments. Encourage a whole-class discussion, ensuring each student contributes. Display a list of key career skills on the board and have students predict the trends and skills necessary for the future workplace. This scaffolding strategy builds context by tapping into students' existing knowledge and interest about career skills. |
| Present Model             | 15 mins | Present a short video featuring industry professionals discussing essential future skills. Task students to listen for specific skills mentioned and take notes. Pair students to compare notes and list skills mentioned. The teacher facilitates the activity by modeling note-taking techniques and highlighting key language structures. This approach minimizes teacher talk, focusing on student interaction. The video acts as an authentic material grounding the lesson in real-world contexts. |
| Useful Language           | 15 mins | Play a vocabulary relay game. Divide students into two teams, and give them a set of vocabulary flashcards with career-related terms. Teams race to match definitions provided on the board with the correct words in a timed challenge. This game-based approach ensures active participation and reinforces vocabulary retention. Provide sentence starters and examples to scaffold usage for each term. Regularly assess understanding with comprehension checks and immediate feedback. |
| Preparation               | 15 mins | Instruct students to individually list three key future skills they want to develop for their careers. Use a graphic organizer to plan how they will use future forms to express these goals. Provide visual aids and example sentences for guidance. Students then practice in pairs, rehearsing expressing their plans. Scaffold this process with sentence starters and peer feedback opportunities. This structured preparation bridges the gap between accuracy and fluency. |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins | Conduct a role-play scenario where pairs of students act as interviewer and interviewee. The interviewee discusses their career goals and the skills they intend to improve. Provide clear role cards and prompts to guide the interaction. Encourage spontaneous conversation, promoting flexibility in language use. Rotate pairs midway to ensure a variety of interactions, maximizing speaking opportunities. Facilitate discussions by monitoring and offering gentle real-time correction as necessary. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Conclude with a class feedback session. Highlight common strengths and areas for improvement observed during the role-plays. Encourage self-assessment by prompting students to reflect on their performance. Use of positive reinforcement to boost confidence. Address frequent language errors by revisiting useful language structures, ensuring clarity and understanding. Reinforce corrections with practice sentences and peer discussion, consolidating the learning experience. |
| Flex-time/Buffer          | 5 mins  | Provide additional time to address any outstanding questions or to briefly discuss unexpected student inquiries related to career skills. This flexibility helps adapt the lesson to the emergent needs of students, ensuring they feel heard and supported. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** For stronger students, encourage complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions. Provide additional scaffolding (sentence starters, visuals) for students needing more support.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid lengthy teacher talk; prioritize student-centered learning through constant interaction and task-based activities.
- **Classroom Management:** Strategically monitor group dynamics for active participation; utilize formative assessments to gauge progress and comprehension.
