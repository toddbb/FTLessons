| Stage                       | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins| Begin by asking students to discuss in pairs, "What do you usually do when you have a lot of things to do in a short amount of time?" Encourage students to think of specific examples. This activity is designed to get students talking immediately, activating their prior experiences related to time management. Circulate around the room, offering support as needed, and select a few pairs to share their ideas with the class. This creates an engaging environment that supports relationship building within the class.                                                                                                                                                                     | Use open body language and encourage students with nods and smiles. Select pairs strategically to ensure a mix of proficiency levels when sharing with the class to support lower-level learners.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins| Show a short 2-minute clip from a TED Talk on productivity. Have students work in small groups to identify key points mentioned in the clip. They should note at least two strategies discussed. After watching, regroup and discuss as a class. This helps contextualize the topic and gives students a chance to collaboratively process information, practicing comprehension skills and critical listening. Use scaffolding techniques such as prompting with follow-up questions and using visual aids or mind maps on the board to consolidate ideas.                                                                                                                                      | Pause the video after key points and ask comprehension questions. Ensure all students understand by using simple language and checking comprehension with thumbs up or down. Use a video source with subtitles if needed to support understanding.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins| Introduce a well-known time-management method, such as the Pomodoro Technique. Provide a brief explanation of the technique using images and written prompts on the board. Conduct a quick demonstration, modeling how to set a timer for 25 minutes and then take a break. Have students practice setting up their own timers on their phones. This hands-on activity helps to illustrate the technique and ties into the theme by demonstrating a real-world application instantly. During the explanation, highlight any specific useful language or vocabulary that appears. Encourage questions and clarify as necessary to ensure clarity.                                                                      | Model the pronunciation of any new vocabulary. Use specific examples to demonstrate how the Pomodoro Technique could be applied in different situations. Provide sentence starters to help students articulate their thoughts. Ensure students know how to use their phones to set a timer, scaffolding the technology use where needed.                                                                                            |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins| Play a game of "Productivity Bingo." Create bingo cards with actions like "Make a to-do list," "Set a timer for tasks," and "Avoid multitasking." Students mingle, asking each other questions like, "Do you make a to-do list every day?" Each square completed represents a question successfully answered. This encourages interaction and practice of modal verbs in context, while building vocabulary around time management. This activity promotes peer learning and independence as students have to think about their strategies. Conclude by discussing which strategies were the most popular and effective.                                                                                                                 | Provide a demonstration round to ensure all students understand the activity. Offer vocabulary assistance and correct use of modal verbs by moving around and engaging with groups. Use visual aids by writing key phrases on the board for reference. Establish clear rules for mingling to maintain focus and order in the classroom.                                                                                             |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins| Have students plan a "perfect productive day" in pairs. Provide graphic organizers for them to jot down tasks from morning to night, prioritizing and scheduling. Ask them to think about what activities prevent productivity and strategies they can introduce to improve. Allow students to share their planners with another pair for feedback. This exercise allows students to apply their language and planning skills practically. Encourage students to use language forms and vocabulary previously introduced while organizing their ideas logically and clearly. This collaborative task supports peer assistance and aids weaker students by organizing thoughts into a clear format.                                         | Monitor and guide pairs to use complete sentences. Provide reminders to use new vocabulary and phrases. Offer assistance with time-related vocabulary and logical connections. Allocate specific time checkpoints for them to complete each part of the planner to keep the activity moving smoothly.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins| Conduct a role-play activity, divided into pairs or small groups. Each group role-plays a scenario such as a busy office worker managing their day, a student juggling work and study, or a freelancer planning the week. Students use their planners to enact conversations about prioritizing tasks and offering advice. Employing their knowledge of time management vocabulary and modal verbs is key here. Allow students to switch roles to ensure full participation. This task maximizes student talk time and helps develop fluency and confidence with speaking. As students perform, take notes on common errors for correction in the feedback stage.                                                                       | Encourage creativity in role-play-scenarios. Provide sentence starters and role-play prompts to help students begin dialogues. Allow flexible grouping if students need varied scenarios or support. Move around offering gentle guidance and encouragement. Confirm groupings ensure varied proficiency levels for peer teaching opportunities.                                                                                               |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| After the role-play, gather students for a feedback session. Start by highlighting what students did well, followed by common language mistakes observed during the activities. Use the whiteboard to correct and explain these errors, focusing particularly on the use of modal verbs and vocabulary. Offer positive reinforcement by highlighting improvements and successful language uses observed. Open the floor to students for self-correction and peer feedback, and use guiding questions to facilitate reflection on the session: "What was challenging?", "What strategy will you try next?". This provides a valuable opportunity for reflection and consolidates learning.                          | Keep feedback criteria-focused and constructive. Allow students autonomy to self-identify errors before providing teacher-led explanations. Encourage students to reflect on how they adapted vocabulary and grammar from the lesson. Use gentle, open questions to promote engagement, ensuring everyone can contribute to the group reflection.                                                                                                          |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins | Use remaining time for any new questions or topics of interest that arose during the session or as needed to extend particular activities slightly to reinforce understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Be adaptable, ready to use this time to wrap up or dig deeper into specific discussion points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation:** Adapt tasks by offering additional vocabulary support to lower-level learners and more challenging task extensions to higher-level students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students might struggle with the pronunciation of multisyllabic words. Provide model pronunciation repeatedly.
- **Classroom Management:** Use non-verbal signals to manage time during activities. Encourage silent signals for students needing assistance.
