This competitive game encourages collaboration and reinforces the retention of new words.                                                     | Monitor and provide support, ensuring correct pronunciation and understanding.                             |
| Preparation               | 15 mins    | Instruct students to plan a short presentation about a cryptocurrency-related topic, such as "How Bitcoin Works." Use scaffolding through graphic organizers to help them organize their thoughts. Ensure students have access to vocabulary lists. Encourage peer collaboration for idea sharing and feedback.                           | Provide sentence starters to assist with sentence construction and clarity of thought.                     |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins    | Students present their topics in pairs or small groups. During presentations, peers should take notes and prepare questions to ask the presenters afterward. Encourage dynamic interaction and feedback. Provide language support as required. This activity enhances fluency and confidence in discussing complex topics.                              | Facilitate the Q&A, encouraging students to elaborate on responses for deeper engagement.                  |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins    | Provide constructive feedback on student presentations, focusing on pronunciation, vocabulary use, and expression clarity. Highlight effective communication strategies observed. Encourage peer feedback by asking groups to share one strength and one area for improvement for each presenter.                                               | Emphasize strengths first before discussing areas for improvement to build confidence.                     |
| Flex-time/Buffer          | 5 mins     | Use this time to address emergent questions or clarifications related to cryptocurrency and digital finance. Allow students to express any final thoughts or questions. If time permits, introduce a quick game-based review of learned vocabulary to reinforce retention.                                                     | Remain flexible to student needs, adjusting content based on classroom responses and discussions.          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer additional vocabulary support or prompts to less confident students. Allow advanced students to explore more complex topics like blockchain technology.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may confuse cryptocurrencies with physical currency. Clarify using visual aids or real-world examples.
- **Classroom Management:** Use pair and group work to minimize teacher talk and maximize student interaction.
