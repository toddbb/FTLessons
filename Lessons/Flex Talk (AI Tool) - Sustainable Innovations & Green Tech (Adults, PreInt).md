## Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                      | Instruction Tips                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Engage students in a brainstorming game called "Green Bingo." Students list green innovations they've heard of and find peers who know about them.| Use visual aids to prompt ideas and ensure understanding.          |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Display images of various green technologies. Facilitate a discussion on what students know about each, encouraging them to share prior knowledge. | Use open-ended questions to elicit students' thoughts.             |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Introduce a short video about a recent green technology. Students answer comprehension questions and discuss key points in pairs.                   | Pause the video to highlight important vocabulary and structures.  |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Play a vocabulary matching game using a digital quiz tool. Students match words with definitions, focusing on green tech terms.                      | Model pronunciation and provide example sentences for clarity.     |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| In groups, students choose a green innovation to research. They plan a short presentation on its benefits and impact, using provided guides.         | Offer graphic organizers to help structure their presentations.    |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Groups present their chosen innovation to the class. Peers provide feedback using sentence starters provided by the teacher.                           | Encourage peer questions for clarification and deeper engagement.  |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins| Provide feedback on presentation skills and language use. Correct errors in vocabulary and structure highlighted during presentations.                   | Use positive reinforcement to boost confidence.                    |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)  | 5 mins | Address any emergent questions or topics that arose during the lesson, providing further clarification and engagement.                                  | Be flexible and responsive to student needs.                       |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Provide additional support for less confident speakers through sentence frames and additional practice time.
- Common Pitfalls: Watch for overuse of fillers during presentations; encourage concise and focused discussions.
- Classroom Management: Keep a positive and supportive atmosphere to promote speaking confidence.
