| **Stage**               | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                          | **Instruction Tips**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                  | 10 mins    | Start with a fun icebreaker game like "Password Charades." Students select common online activities written on paper slips (e.g., sending an email, posting a photo) and mime them for classmates to guess. This activity lowers affective barriers by building rapport and introducing the topic in an engaging way. It allows students to begin thinking about various online interactions they engage with daily, gently leading them toward more serious cybersecurity discussions. Teacher should circulate to ensure each group functions effectively, providing hints as needed.                                                                                                                      | Keep the mimes simple to accommodate all language levels. Use exaggerated gestures for clarity.                                                                   |
| Lead-In / Set Context   | 10 mins    | Introduce the topic of cybersecurity by showing an engaging video that illustrates a simple cyberattack scenario (without sound) and pause frequently to ask students prediction questions about what might happen. Use a think-pair-share approach so students can discuss their predictions before sharing with the class. This scaffolds student understanding by providing clear, visual context while encouraging peer collaboration. Students can use sentence starters like "I think..." or "It might be..." to boost confidence.                                                                                                       | Pause the video at key moments for predictions, using visuals to guide comprehension. Provide sentence starters for predictions.                                      |
| Present Model           | 15 mins    | Present an authentic dialogue related to cybersecurity awareness (simplified with key vocabulary highlighted). Students listen to the conversation between two peers discussing cybersecurity threats and how to protect themselves online. They fill in a gap-fill activity to gently assess comprehension and reinforce key vocabulary. This phase models correct language use in context, highlighting target vocabulary while maintaining a student-centered approach. After listening, students attempt to reconstruct parts of the dialogue in pairs, with teacher monitoring and guiding as needed.                                                 | Ensure students have printed copies or visual access to the material. Guide students through any challenging vocabulary with visual aids or images when necessary.     |
| Useful Language         | 15 mins    | Using a digital platform like Kahoot!, engage students in a vocabulary quiz on key cybersecurity terms introduced earlier in the lesson. Include terms like "hacker," "privacy," and "update." This game-based activity builds language accuracy and enhances recall in a dynamic, competitive format. Encourage students to discuss their answers in pairs before submitting to facilitate peer support and conversational practice. Regular formative assessment is integrated through immediate feedback and correction.                                                              | Encourage full participation by allowing students to work in pairs, using pair collaboration to check understanding. Provide vocabulary lists if needed.               |
| Preparation             | 15 mins    | Students brainstorm in small groups, role-playing as a family discussing online behaviors. They list daily online actions (e.g., using social media, downloading apps) and evaluate them for potential cybersecurity risks using a graphic organizer. Teacher circulates, posing guiding questions and providing sentence prompts and examples, leading students towards independent, critical evaluation of online behaviors. The gradual release of responsibility is implied as students transition from teacher-led discussion to independent analysis.                                   | Provide examples of both risky and safe online behaviors to guide the groups. Use visual aids to organize and support group discussions.                               |
| Complete Task           | 35 mins    | Students role-play a "Cybersecurity Awareness Day," presenting short dialogues or skits based on their group discussions about online safety tips. They must collaboratively develop and perform a short presentation with visual support, e.g., handmade posters or a simple slideshow. This task allows students to apply language skills expressively and creatively, focusing on fluency, spontaneity, and comprehensibility. A peer feedback session follows, where each group shares one compliment and one improvement suggestion for a fellow group, fostering deeper understanding and interactive practice.               | Encourage creativity in presentations—reward humor and originality to maintain engagement. Provide tools for visual supports (markers, paper, digital aids) as needed. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins    | Facilitate a group reflection session. Quickly review key errors observed during the skits, focusing on recurrent vocabulary misuse or pronunciation issues. Encourage students to self-correct by asking leading questions. Conclude with positive affirmation of strengths displayed during the tasks. The scaffolding strategy ensures corrections are both educational and supportive, reinforcing a positive classroom environment while focusing on individualized improvement.                                                                                                     | Use a whiteboard or visual aid to note commonly misused words or phrases. Offer explicit praise alongside any suggestions for reinforcement.                             |

### Teacher Notes and Tips

- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing additional support for peer-guided learning.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with new terminology, so provide additional practice where necessary.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure everyone participates; in larger classes, divide into smaller groups to ensure individual attention.
