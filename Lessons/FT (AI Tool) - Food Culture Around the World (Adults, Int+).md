| Stage                       | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Instruction Tips                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                      | 10 mins| Start by greeting the students and initiating a quick discussion about their favorite foods. Use a "Find Someone Who" activity where students circulate and find classmates who like specific food items or have tried unique dishes. This activity promotes a relaxed atmosphere and encourages spontaneous conversation, warming up the learners’ speaking skills and building rapport.                            | Encourage students to elaborate when asking and answering questions. Walk around to provide support and encourage participation.                                             |
| Lead-In / Set Context       | 10 mins| Show pictures of various international dishes and ask students to identify them. Elicit what they know about these dishes and their origins. Transition by discussing how food is an integral part of culture and identity. Use a short video showcasing diverse food markets around the world to set context and engage interest. Reactivate prior knowledge and stimulate curiosity about global cuisines.         | Encourage students to share their thoughts and connections with the foods shown. Use prompting questions to guide discussion.                                               |
| Present Model               | 15 mins| Display a model dialogue between two people discussing food culture using a transcript or audio clip. Assign students to work in pairs, where one reads/acts while the other listens and identifies key phrases used in the conversation, particularly focusing on how they discuss food and cultural elements. This highlights target language expressions naturally embedded in authentic communication.                | Pause audio at key points to highlight expressions. Encourage students to discuss the cultural aspects mentioned independently before revealing the correct expressions.    |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins| Introduce a digital game-based vocabulary activity using platforms like Quizlet Live or Kahoot focused on food-related vocabulary and adjectives. Encourage students to participate in teams, providing each team with a digital device. The game reinforces vocabulary through competition and collaboration, with a focus on correct pronunciation and use in context, enhancing both reactive and productive lexical skills. | Monitor for accurate usage and pronunciation during the activity. Debrief by discussing challenging vocabulary items afterward.                                            |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins| In pairs or small groups, students choose a country and research its food culture using provided resources (handouts, online articles, recipe cards). They plan a short presentation covering key aspects such as traditional dishes, cultural significance, and personal opinions. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their ideas, facilitate organization, and support collaboration.                     | Offer guiding questions and ensure students understand tasks. Check in on progress and provide formative feedback as needed.                                                |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins| Groups take turns presenting their chosen food culture to the class. Audience members are responsible for asking questions and providing feedback, fostering active listening and interaction. Encourage presenters to use modal verbs for advice/obligation (e.g., "You must try sushi when you visit Japan.") to practice target language in context. This real-world task promotes fluency and cultural exchange. | Maintain a supportive environment. Offer positive feedback and constructive suggestions for improvement. Facilitate peer feedback.                                           |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins| Conduct a reflective session. Start with peer feedback where groups highlight one strong point and one area for improvement for each presentation. Follow up with teacher-led feedback focusing on common language issues noted. Use a mix of explicit corrections and eliciting peer corrections to address errors in vocabulary, grammar (especially modals), and pronunciation.                                        | Utilize a gentle approach to error correction. Use positive reinforcement, encouraging students to self-correct with peer support.                                          |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins | Allow time for any emergent questions, further practice on challenging areas, or additional explanation of cultural points that arose during the presentations. This time can be adapted based on students' needs and responses throughout the lesson.                                                                                                                      | Be flexible with this time. Use it to extend learning or to address unfinished activities. Encourage open-ended questioning. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiation: Provide additional vocabulary support for lower-level students and challenge higher-level learners with more complex language structures.
- Common Pitfalls: Students may struggle with pronunciation of certain food names; provide phonetic assistance.
- Classroom Management: Foster a positive, inclusive environment where students feel comfortable sharing and making mistakes. Use turn-taking strategies during presentations to maintain engagement.
