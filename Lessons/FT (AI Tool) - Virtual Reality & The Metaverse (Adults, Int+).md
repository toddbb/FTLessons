| Stage                        | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins| Start with a quick brainstorming session where students share what they know about VR and the metaverse. Use a digital whiteboard to note their ideas. Encourage students to share any personal experiences with VR. Focus on building rapport and creating a lively atmosphere.                                                   | Ensure a supportive environment. Encourage even quieter students to share.                                                                               |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins| Screen a short video showcasing the current applications of VR in various fields. Students work in pairs to discuss what they observed and speculate on its uses beyond what's shared in the video. Follow up with a class discussion to elicit ideas and get everyone engaged.                                                | Prompt students with: "What surprised you?" or "Have you seen something similar before?"                                                                 |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins| Present an authentic article about how businesses are using the metaverse. Task the students with finding key information and reporting back. Model an example of scanning for key points, maintaining a student-centered approach. Students practice reading for details in pairs and share findings with another pair.                  | Use peer correction to elicit answers. Have students underline unknown vocabulary, which they can define collaboratively.                                  |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins| Introduce vocabulary through a matching game. Students work in small groups to match new words to their definitions and use each in a sentence. Use visuals and prompts to support understanding. Consider phrases like "virtual reality," "metaverse," "immersive experience," and "digital interaction."                          | Regular check-ins to assess understanding. Provide sentence starters, e.g., "In the metaverse, people can..." Develop peer-to-peer support using groups.   |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins| Divide the students into small groups, assigning each a role-play scenario where VR or the metaverse solves a typical problem in everyday life or business. Provide scaffolding through structured outlines and key phrases. Allow time for planning and rehearsal to promote fluency and cohesion.                            | Circulate to offer support, monitoring use of vocabulary and structure. Encourage utilizing all group members' ideas in the presentation.                  |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins| Students conduct their role-plays using VR/metaverse concepts. Each group presents, while others note down key points and offer feedback. Encourage interactive dialogue, with questions following each presentation to deepen comprehension and application. This stage prioritizes student-centered interaction.             | Minimize teacher talk. Use a timer if needed to maintain pace. Encourage active listening and questions from the audience to enhance understanding.         |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| Give constructive feedback focusing on the accurate use of vocabulary, fluency, and creativity. Incorporate peer feedback, reinforcing constructive criticism and compliments. Address common errors anonymously, focusing on correction and understanding, rather than directly pointing at individuals' mistakes. | Use positive reinforcement to bolster student confidence. Offer corrective feedback with strategies for improvement.                                       |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)** | 5 mins| Open the floor for any questions or clarifications. Use this time to revisit any content or vocabulary that posed challenges. Reinforce key takeaways from the lesson.                                                                                                                                | Be flexible and responsive to emergent needs or interests. Reassure students about any doubts.                                                           |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies**: Offer additional support for lower-level students through sentence stems and vocabulary lists. Challenge advanced students with additional research or presentation tasks.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure vocabulary pronunciation is clear, and encourage full participation to avoid dominant speakers overshadowing quieter students.
- **Classroom Management**: Move around the room to maintain engagement and provide discreet support where needed. Use positive body language to encourage contributions.
