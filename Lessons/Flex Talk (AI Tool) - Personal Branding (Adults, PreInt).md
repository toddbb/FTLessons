|-------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**              | 10 mins | Begin with an interactive “branding” game where students pair up and have 3 minutes to "brand" their partner using three words after a short discussion. This gets students speaking and thinking about attributes that define themselves. As they share, write some key words (like creative, reliable) on the board to build initial vocabulary. Discuss how these words contribute to their personal and professional brand.                                                                | Encourage casual conversation and ensure everyone is engaged. Model how to describe someone using positive adjectives. Keep it lighthearted to ease into the topic. |

| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show short video clips of well-known personalities. Ask students which characteristics stand out and why. Create a mind-map on the board with categories such as strengths and values. Have students contribute ideas about what personal branding might include and its potential impact. Conduct a small group discussion on how the idea of personal branding applies to their own lives.                                                                | Use visuals to keep attention focused. Elicit responses about familiar figures to make connections with students’ prior knowledge.                                  |

| **Present Model**       | 15 mins | Introduce models of personal branding statements from professionals in various fields. Provide students with a worksheet with fill-in-the-blank examples of personal branding statements. Ask students to complete the statements using their own information. While students work, circulate to offer guidance and help with vocabulary and grammar. Afterwards, students read aloud their statements to partners and provide feedback based on clarity and impact.                                                | Ensure examples are varied and accessible. Offer plenty of synonyms for vocabulary improvement. Encourage creativity within the statement constraints.             |

| **Useful Language**     | 15 mins | Conduct a game-based vocabulary activity using flashcards. Each card has a branding-related word, definition, example, and Vietnamese translation. Divide students into small teams. Each team draws a card and must use the word in a sentence related to their personal brand. Teams earn points for correct usage and creativity. Provide feedback and clarification as necessary, and encourage peer feedback on usage and examples.                                                                                     | Keep the pace lively to maintain engagement. Offer immediate corrections where needed but focus on positive reinforcement. Encourage team collaboration and creativity. |

| **Preparation**         | 15 mins | Have students individually write a draft of their personal branding statement. Provide a worksheet with prompts and sentence starters to assist them, such as "I am known for..." or "My value lies in...". Ask students to consider and note their strengths, experiences, and unique traits. Offer students options for framing their statement positively and professionally. Encourage use of vocabulary from prior activities.                                                                                        | Support students who struggle with prompts by offering examples and pairing them for peer help. Allow some flexibility in time if needed for those struggling.     |

| **Complete Task**       | 35 mins | Organize a "Brand Showcase" where students present their personal branding statements to small groups. Each student speaks for two minutes, introducing themselves and their brand using the language and skills developed. Peers provide feedback on three aspects: clarity, persuasiveness, and engagement. Instruct them to use a checklist to ensure feedback is comprehensive. Rotate groups to increase interaction and exposure to different perspectives.                                                   | Monitor for balanced participation and gently coax quieter students into speaking. Encourage students to focus on each other's strengths in feedback.               |

| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Engage in a whole-class reflection on the activity. Ask students to share their experience doing the branding task and any new insights about themselves. Provide constructive feedback on common language issues and highlight exemplary phrases or statements. Use the opportunity to reinforce pronunciation skills by spotlighting exemplary stress and intonation from student presentations, allowing peers to practice in pairs.                                                      | Focus on fostering a supportive atmosphere. Use examples generously to demonstrate good language usage while tactfully correcting errors for learning.               |

| **Flex-time/Buffer**    | 5 mins  | Use this time to address any emergent questions, recap key vocabulary, or if ahead, briefly introduce related topics or future personal development projects. Encourage students to reflect on how they might apply today's lesson in real-world scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Adapt this time based on the class flow and student needs. Be flexible in providing additional resources or support as required.                                   |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer differentiated vocabulary lists or sentence starters for varying proficiency levels. Encourage advanced students to incorporate more complex structures.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure understanding of vocabulary and pronunciation to avoid misunderstanding. Monitor for overuse of jargon.
