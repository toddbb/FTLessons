| **Stage** | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description and Instructions** | **Teacher Notes and Tips** |
|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Warmer | 10 mins | Begin with a quick game of "Travel Bingo." Create bingo cards with various travel-related images such as airplanes, suitcases, passports, etc. Students will circulate, asking classmates questions like "Have you ever flown in an airplane?" to check off items. This activity activates students' prior knowledge and gets them talking immediately. Encourage students to speak only English, building a comfortable environment for language use. Check off items on their bingo cards as they confirm experiences. | Ensure all students understand the game. Model asking and answering questions to demonstrate the activity. Monitor and support students who may struggle, ensuring everyone completes at least one line on the bingo card. |
| Lead-In / Set Context | 10 mins | Initiate a discussion about exciting travel destinations. Use images or short video clips of various travel locations. Ask students to describe what they see, encouraging descriptive language. Invite them to share any personal travel experiences. Use this as an opportunity to introduce new vocabulary explicitly, such as "destination," "journey," and "exploration." This will set the context for the entire lesson, establishing a link between travel experiences and vocabulary. | Incorporate visual aids to stimulate interest and comprehension. Conduct a group brainstorm on the board, recording new words. Encourage peer-sharing of experiences. |
| Present Model | 15 mins | Provide a short dialogue where two people discuss booking a trip and planning adventures. Ensure the conversation highlights key phrases and vocabulary. Distribute copies of the dialogue, and play an audio recording, allowing students to follow with a task of filling in missing words. Then, students will practice the conversation in pairs. Encourage them to focus on pronunciation and intonation. This stage is crucial in providing a model and scaffold for upcoming role-plays. | Play the recording twice for familiarity. Scaffold listening with fill-in-the-gap exercises. Provide pronunciation support, and model challenging phrases. Conduct comprehension checks with questions after the recording. |
| Useful Language | 15 mins | Conduct a role-play game called "Travel Planning Challenge." Provide each pair of students with a scenario card, such as booking a hotel or asking for directions. They must use modal verbs to give suggestions and advice. Offer sentence starters like "You should," "Why don't we," or "How about." Encourage creativity and provide a vocabulary list. This game encourages spontaneous use of language in a fun, engaging way, reinforcing modal verbs and travel vocabulary. | Monitor for correct usage of target language. Offer feedback during the activity. Use formative assessment by listening to the language used and providing immediate support where necessary. |
| Preparation | 15 mins | Allow pairs time to prepare a travel itinerary presentation based on a given destination and situation. They need to plan activities, choose accommodation, and consider transportation. Provide graphic organizers to help them structure their plan. Students should incorporate as much target language as possible. This preparation time is important for consolidating learning and ensuring students are ready for fluency practice. | Guide students in organizing their ideas with visual aids and prompts. Offer support to groups needing additional help. Confirm all students have a clear plan and understand the task. |
| Complete Task | 35 mins | Students now present their travel plans to the class in a "Travel Expo" setup, simulating real travel agents presenting packages. Encourage the class to ask questions and give feedback, focusing on practicing conversational skills and interaction. This activity should include both speaking and listening components as students present and interact. Ensure students use spontaneity and creativity, employing vocabulary and structures practiced earlier. | Provide each student with a checklist of vocabulary and structures to include in their presentation, encouraging breadth in language use. Facilitate the discussion, ensuring all students participate equally. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Conduct whole-class feedback, focusing on common language errors, particularly in pronunciation and grammar. Use positive reinforcement for successes observed during the presentations. Encourage peer feedback, allowing students to express what they enjoyed about others' travel plans. Offer corrective feedback with focus on language accuracy, providing models for improvement. This final stage reinforces learning and supports ongoing language development. | Use the board to note errors and corrections. Ensure feedback is constructive and encouraging. Encourage students to reflect on what they learned. |
