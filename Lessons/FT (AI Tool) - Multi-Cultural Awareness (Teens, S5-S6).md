### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                       | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins| Start with a quick "cultural symbols" guessing game. Show images of different cultural symbols (e.g., Eiffel Tower, sushi) and ask students to identify the culture and share what they know. Students work in pairs, fostering collaboration and interest in the topic.| Use visuals to engage students. Encourage pair discussions to ensure all students are participating.                     |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins| Introduce the term "multiculturalism" with a short video clip showcasing diverse cultures in a city. Follow up with a teacher-led discussion asking students to share anything they noticed. This activates prior knowledge and sets a real-world context for the lesson. | Keep teacher talk to a minimum, guiding students with open-ended questions. Use Think-Pair-Share to increase engagement. |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins| Provide students with a short text featuring interviews with people from multicultural backgrounds. Students read in pairs and underline key language related to multiculturalism. Each pair summarizes their interviewee's viewpoint to the class, offering exposure to authentic language. | Use sentence starters to help students present ("In the text, they mentioned..." etc.). Model how to summarize effectively. |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins| Engage students in a vocabulary matching game. Present a list of words related to multiculturalism and definitions without proper matches. Students race in teams to correctly match all terms. This game aids in reinforcing and contextualizing essential vocabulary.          | Provide a visual glossary and encourage peer teaching. Use a timer to increase engagement.                               |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins| Have students brainstorm in groups how they would explain multiculturalism to someone from a different cultural background. Provide sentence starters and a graphic organizer to help them structure their explanations. Allow time for feedback within groups.            | Prompt with guiding questions. Check understanding by randomly selecting students to explain sections.                   |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins| Conduct a role-play activity. Students are assigned roles (tourist, local, immigrant) and placed in scenarios involving multicultural interactions. They perform skits, focusing on clear communication and integrating vocabulary explored earlier. Instructor facilitates, ensuring authentic dialogue. | Initially model the role-play, highlighting key language. Circulate to provide formative feedback. Ensure inclusivity.    |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide specific feedback on the role-play presentations, focusing on pronunciation, vocabulary use, and fluency. Correct any common errors observed. Encourage self-reflection by inviting students to discuss what they found challenging or interesting.              | Use a positive approach, highlighting success. Allow students time for peer feedback.                                  |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins| Conduct a quick Kahoot! quiz revisiting the lesson's key vocabulary and cultural concepts. This provides an engaging closure and checks for understanding while addressing any remaining misconceptions.                                                                        | Use the quiz results to informally assess understanding and clarify any mistakes.                                        |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing support. Use visuals and simplified texts for lower-level learners.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may confuse definitions; reinforce through varied contexts.
- **Classroom Management:** Monitor group activity noise levels, ensuring productive discussions without disruptions.
