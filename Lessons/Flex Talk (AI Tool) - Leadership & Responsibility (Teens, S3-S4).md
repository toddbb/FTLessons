### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Warmer | 10 mins | Begin the lesson by energizing students with a quick game called "Word Association". Write the word "leader" on the board and ask students to say the first word that comes to their mind when they see it. Capture all responses on the board, prompting quick thinking and participation. This will activate prior knowledge and contextual understanding about leadership. Use students’ associations to introduce the lesson topic. Ensure to scaffold by modeling how to associate words. Regularly check comprehension by asking questions about the relevance of the words shared. Encourage peer support by having students in pairs come up with a sentence using two words from the board. |
| Lead-In/Set Context | 10 mins | Present a short "Leadership & Teamwork" video clip, focusing on key elements like responsibility and teamwork. Before playing, provide students with a task: Listen for how the leader resolves conflict in the video. Repeat specific parts if necessary, pausing to ensure understanding. After viewing, have students discuss in small groups what responsibilities they noticed. Provide sentence starters like "In the video, the leader...," encouraging use of the target vocabulary. Use visual aids and prompts to maintain focus. Scaffold understanding through guided questioning and pair-share activities to deduce meaning collectively. |
| Present Model | 15 mins | Provide a language model by sharing a dialogue that demonstrates conflict resolution within a team. Distribute a handout with the dialogue, and read it aloud, modeling pronunciation and intonation. Students then role-play the dialogue in pairs, taking turns to be the leader and the team member. Emphasize the phrases used for leading and resolving issues. Use guided examples to highlight key expressions. Implement peer discussions to practice further, encouraging deeper investigation into language use. Circulate the room to monitor progress and offer targeted guidance. Conclude with a brief class discussion on how responsibility was shown in the dialogue. |
| Useful Language | 15 mins | Conduct a vocabulary-building game called "Vocabulary Ladder." List vocabulary words, such as leader, teamwork, resolve, and decision on the board. Divide students into teams and ask them to form sentences using each word, climbing the "ladder" with each correct sentence. Use flashcards with pictures to reinforce meaning. Offer sentence structures and language frames to support sentence formation. After each round, conduct mini formative assessments by asking different teams to explain their sentence meanings. This approach promotes cooperative learning and strategic use of language patterns. Ensure continuous engagement by prompting student-led language checks among peers. |
| Preparation | 15 mins | In small groups, students plan a short role-play in which they resolve a conflict as a team, integrating the target language. Provide them with guidance by reviewing the useful phrases and vocabulary. Use graphic organizers to help students outline their role-play structure, emphasizing the beginning, conflict point, resolution, and ending. Regularly check progress with formative questions like "What language will you use for resolution?" Encourage groups to rehearse and offer constructive feedback to each other. Rotate among groups, providing strategies and suggestions for improvement. Highlight the importance of both verbal and non-verbal communication in their presentations. |
| Complete Task | 35 mins | Groups perform their role-plays to the class, focusing on leadership and resolving conflicts. During performances, classmates take notes on effective uses of language and leadership strategies. Facilitate active engagement by assigning each student a specific aspect of communication to observe, such as tone or vocabulary. After every performance, hold a group reflection where students share observations and provide feedback using a positive and constructive approach. Rotate roles within the group to ensure balanced participation. Encourage additional rounds if time permits, allowing students to apply feedback for improvement. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Conclude with feedback for each group, focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement. Use targeted positive reinforcement to highlight effective communication and leadership signs. Constructively address common language errors observed during performances. Engage in class discussion to reflect collectively on what was learned, using prompts like “What did you learn about leadership?” Facilitate peer feedback by having students share one thing they thought another group did well. Utilize error correction techniques such as reformulating incorrect sentences to guide improvements without discouragement. Celebrate class achievements and progress made during the session. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation strategies include pairing students with varied English proficiency levels, allowing for peer teaching opportunities.
- Anticipate that students may struggle with expressing ideas due to limited vocabulary; use ample visuals and sentence starters as support.
- Manage classroom dynamics by assigning roles during activities to ensure all students participate equally.
