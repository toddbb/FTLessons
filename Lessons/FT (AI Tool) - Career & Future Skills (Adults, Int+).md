### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                      | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins| Begin with a quick-paced icebreaker that encourages students to share one future career aspiration with the class. Use a beach ball; when students catch the ball, they share their goal. This activity fosters engagement and rapport while introducing the topic of careers. Teacher models a few examples, such as “I want to be a software engineer.” This activity uses peer sharing to create a supportive learning environment.                     |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins| Show a short video clip featuring emerging career trends. Ask students to watch for particular skills mentioned. Follow up with a discussion in pairs about what trends they noticed. Teacher walks around, providing prompts and helping lower-level students by giving sentence starters such as “One trend I noticed was...” This scaffolding encourages active listening and ensures full participation.                                                 |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins| Display a digital presentation highlighting a role-play dialog set in a job interview. Students listen as they read along. Use a guided worksheet to draw attention to key language aspects – especially modal verbs and vocabulary. Teacher demonstrates a thought process, like deciding when to use "might" vs. "will," thereby modeling strategic thinking. Form questions focus students on the functional language for discussing future skills. |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins| Introduce a competitive flashcard matching game. Cards have either questions or answers related to career skills. Students work in teams to match them correctly. Teacher monitors, facilitating if-needed language support. Team play motivates learners, and real-time corrections serve as formative assessment. Repetition reinforces vocabulary acquisition and usage.                                                               |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins| Students plan a short presentation about one future career skill they wish to develop. Provide graphic organizers with sections like “Skill Description,” “Why Important,” and “How to Develop.” Teacher gives examples, guiding students on filling in gaps appropriately, ensuring balance between content accuracy and fluency. Frequent peer feedback checks scaffold the creation process.                                                              |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins| In groups, students present their skill perspectives. Other groups listen, take notes, and prepare one question. Teacher observes, allowing peer-driven interactions while noting language issues for subsequent feedback. Interaction time develops spontaneous speaking skills, fostering real-world conversational dynamics. Group feedback teaches reflection and efficient communication.                                                           |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Teacher leads a feedback session, highlighting strengths and addressing common errors. Using the whiteboard, examples from students’ performances are corrected collaboratively. Students rephrase sentences and experiment with varied expressions. Praise fosters confidence, while strategic corrections enhance language precision. Teacher notes refer to authentic language use, promoting peer support via reflective questioning.                                  |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins | Address any additional questions or facilitate a quick vocabulary bingo game utilizing terms from today’s lesson. This flexibility tailors attention to emergent needs and reinforces retention. Instant feedback supports learners’ lexical choices, improving their retrieval fluency.                                                                                                                                                 |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Group students heterogeneously to encourage peer support. Provide additional sentence starters for struggling students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for misuse of modals; prompt student self-correction when feasible.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure all students are involved in activities by actively monitoring group interactions and offering help as needed.
