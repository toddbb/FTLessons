| Stage                         | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins| Start the lesson by showing short video clips from popular K-pop music videos, anime scenes, or a trending movie trailer. Ask students to work in pairs to guess the genre and discuss if they recognize any of the clips. This will build interest and activate prior knowledge.   | Encourage all students to participate by asking simple questions like "Do you know this artist?" or "What is your favorite part of the video?" Use visual aids to ensure understanding and create a lively atmosphere.                                                               |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins| Show a mind map with "Global Pop Culture" in the center, and elicit students to add branches such as K-pop, anime, and streaming platforms. Ask them to discuss in small groups their exposure to these elements and share what they like most.                                  | Use sentence starters on the board like "I like...", "I often watch...". Walk around the room to provide support, ensuring everyone can contribute at their own comfort level. Confirm comprehension with brief questions during discussions.                                          |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins| Provide a short dialogue between two friends talking about a new anime and a K-pop band. Play the audio and provide a transcript. In pairs, students listen and underline key expressions, like "I love this anime because..." and "My favorite artist is...".                    | Use the Gradual Release of Responsibility model. First, model the process of underlining with one example, then have the students try it. Check comprehension by asking pairs to share one expression they underlined with the class.                                                 |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins| Organize a game of "Expression Bingo" where students have cards with phrases like "I'm a fan of...", "I prefer...", etc. Read out definitions or synonyms, and students mark their cards if they have the relevant phrase. This reinforces phrases in an engaging way.             | Model how to play Bingo with one example to ensure clarity. Use pictures and actions to convey the meanings of phrases. Regularly pause to check students' cards and offer help to those who seem stuck, maintaining a supportive learning environment.                                 |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins| In small groups, allow students to choose a pop culture topic that interests them (e.g., a specific anime or movie) and create a short presentation. They will discuss the reasons for their interests using target language. Provide graphic organizers to help structure ideas.  | Encourage creativity in presentations and offer sentence frames to support language use. Have students share ideas with you first to ensure clarity and preparedness. Make sure that each group member has a speaking role to promote participation.                                    |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins| Groups present their pop culture topic to the class. Encourage the audience to ask questions and engage in short discussions. Use flashcards with question prompts like "Why do you like this?" or "What is special about it?" to guide interactions.                              | Reduce teacher talk by letting students facilitate the Q&A. Praise every contribution and provide feedback that elicits further discussion. Take notes on language use for feedback later, ensuring that responses are encouraging and build on students' comments.                       |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Provide personalized feedback focusing on common language errors observed during presentations. Use a whiteboard to correct grammatical errors together as a class. Offer praise for effective language use and highlight exceptional contributions.                                | Keep a positive tone and highlight progress by celebrating successful use of new vocabulary or expressions. Encourage self-correction by asking questions like, "Is there a different way to say that?" Help students feel supported and motivated through constructive feedback.       |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins | Allow students to ask additional questions or share pop culture interests they may not have had the opportunity to discuss. Use this time for informal conversations to strengthen the class community.                                                                    | Listen actively to students’ interests and validate their experiences. This is a great opportunity to build rapport and make them feel valued. Encourage connections between students' comments and shared class topics.                                                             |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Vary the complexity of sentence starters and scaffold presentations with graphic organizers.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure vocabulary is pre-taught to avoid comprehension issues during the Present Model stage.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage respectful listening during presentations and structure feedback to promote constructive peer evaluations.
