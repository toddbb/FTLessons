### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                          | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                         | 10 mins| Start with a simple networking game called "Two Truths and a Lie." Each student writes down two truths and one lie about themselves. Students pair up and guess each other's lie. This serves to break the ice, get students to speak English, and begin interacting. Encourage all students to ask follow-up questions after guesses are made, which helps to establish a friendly rapport from the outset. Monitor and collect common errors for later feedback. The activity prepares them to think about relevant details of their lives, which they’ll later share in the context of networking. | Ensure students feel comfortable by encouraging laughter and openness while guessing and discussing. Provide an example to model the activity. Monitor pairs and offer corrections if necessary.  |
| Lead-In / Set Context          | 10 mins| Discuss the importance of networking with the class. Begin with the question: "Why is networking important in today’s world?" Generate a brainstorming session while writing key ideas on the board. Guide students to consider both professional and informal settings. Use real life examples (e.g., attending a conference or meeting new colleagues). Provide visuals or short video clips showcasing effective networking scenarios. The class then works in small groups to categorize their ideas into 'Professional' and 'Informal' networking. Scaffolding is provided as students can use sentence starters and prompts. | Encourage quieter students to contribute by asking questions directly. Use graphic organizers to help students categorize ideas. Check understanding through Q&A. Foster peer support.           |
| Present Model                  | 15 mins| Play an audio clip of a networking conversation in a professional setting. Before playing, instruct students to listen for specific information: How do the speakers introduce themselves? What questions do they ask each other? Post-listening, students discuss in pairs what they heard, referring to detailed listening tasks such as filling in missing information. This activity places students in the role of active listeners to model good networking practice. Follow this with a script analysis to highlight commonly used phrases, sentence structures (e.g., “Have you been to...?”), and intonation patterns. Use the whiteboard to underscore these phrases and patterns. | Play the audio twice to ensure comprehension. Pause at sections during the second playthrough for targeted listening points. Engage students with open-ended questions to draw out their observations. |
| Useful Language                | 15 mins| Introduce a role-playing game called "Networking Bingo." Create bingo cards with networking scenarios such as "Introduce yourself to someone who has traveled to more than three countries" or "Find someone who has a similar career goal." Students move around the room completing the bingo card by introducing themselves and asking questions to find someone who fits the scenario. Pre-teach necessary vocabulary and phrases through a handout which includes sentence starters and model questions. This game encourages practice in a dynamic setting, balancing language acquisition with authentic usage. | Ensure each bingo scenario aligns well with B1-B2 vocabulary and phrases. Use a variety of scenarios to keep interactions lively. Provide ongoing support by circulating and facilitating conversations.       |
| Preparation                    | 15 mins| Students plan a role-play scenario simulating a networking event, grouping in threes (A, B, C). Each group receives a specific context card: a business conference, an online digital networking event, or a casual after-work mixer. They decide roles and prepare introductions and questions in advance, using vocabulary from earlier sessions. Provide graphic organizers to help them structure their ideas. Ensure students write down key phrases they will use in their interactions. This stage empowers students to organize information meaningfully for upcoming role plays. | Guide students with individualized feedback as they fill out their organizers. Encourage the use of all introduced vocabulary. Answer any individual concerns students may have regarding their presentation.         |
| Complete Task                  | 35 mins| Groups perform their role-play scenarios. One by one, each group takes turns presenting to the class, simulating the actual networking environment as closely as possible. Start with a brief setup to establish the context, then allow students to engage organically. Encourage 'spectator' students to observe, take notes, and later constructively critique the interactions. Ensure that each student in a group has a fair opportunity to present and interact. This immersive task is fundamental in consolidating learning by providing robust, contextual speaking practice. Through constructive peer-feedback, students recognize effective strategies and areas for improvement. | Balance participation by encouraging quieter students to engage first if necessary. Offer each group a structured peer-feedback form, prompting them to note positives and areas for improvement. Incentivize quality engagement with positive reinforcement.		    |
| Feedback/Error Correction      | 15 mins| End with a class discussion on what worked well and what could be improved from the role plays. Use your notes from monitoring to address common errors or particularly effective uses of language. Focus on common intonation and pronunciation issues experienced during the tasks. Offer individual feedback while maintaining a supportive and motivational class atmosphere. Reinforce areas of success as benchmarks for ongoing practice. Utilize an interactive whiteboard for group feedback, marking errors and corrected forms as a visual reminder. | Ensure feedback is both practical and actionable. Offer positive feedback to individuals who responded well to correction during the tasks. Let students ask about their specific errors without judgement.   |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)    | 5 mins | Allow students to ask lingering questions or seek clarification on topics not fully addressed. Optionally, use this time for a quick review game such as "Networking Charades," where students act out different networking scenarios. | Be sensitive to the differing language abilities and confidence levels in your class. Provide positive encouragement for everyone participating, regardless of language proficiency.                |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide additional sentence starters or role-play options for lower-level students. For advanced students, introduce more complex scenarios or sophisticated vocabulary.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for nervousness during spontaneous speaking tasks; offer supportive interventions when needed.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure students stay on task during role plays. Engage through direct questions and keep energy levels high with consistent movement and varied activities.
