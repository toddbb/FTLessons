| Stage                            | Timing  | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Instruction Tips                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                       | 10 mins | Start with a quick icebreaker where students share one healthy habit they have and why they think it’s important. This sets a positive tone and helps build rapport. Encourage students to elaborate using vocabulary they already know. Use this opportunity to introduce any new vocabulary that might pop up. Ensure everyone has a chance to speak by circulating and prompting quieter students to share their thoughts. This activity also facilitates a relaxed atmosphere, easing any initial tensions, and sets the context for the lesson.                                           | Encourage students to listen actively to their peers and ask follow-up questions.                           |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**        | 10 mins | Show a short video clip about a popular fitness trend. After watching, ask students what they noticed and lead a brief discussion. Prompt them with questions like, "What do you think about this trend?" and "Would you try it?" This helps activate prior knowledge and generate interest in the topic. Encourage students to use any relevant vocabulary they already possess and gently correct errors by repeating students' sentences with corrections. If the content introduces new terms, pause to write them down and explain.                                          | Use visuals and gestures to aid understanding.                                                              |
| **Present Model**                | 15 mins | Present a dialogue between two people discussing their health routines. Break students into pairs and assign roles. Ask them to listen for specific vocabulary and phrases while modeling positive pronunciation. After listening, ask comprehension questions to ensure understanding. Then, have students try to mimic the dialogue in pairs, checking their pronunciation and intonation. Focus on the use of modals for giving advice within the dialogue. As a class, discuss how these grammar points are used in context.                                        | Use voice intonation and gestures to emphasize key points. Provide a handout of the dialogue for practice. |
| **Useful Language**              | 15 mins | Conduct a game-based activity such as a "Vocabulary Bingo" where students mark off health-related words on a bingo card as they hear them used in class discussion or in audio examples. To scaffold learning, explain each new word's meaning clearly and provide example sentences. Pair students and have them create short scenarios using the new vocabulary, helping each other and offering peer feedback. Walk around to aid and correct where necessary, ensuring comprehensive understanding. Use bingo to generate excitement and energy.                    | Keep the pace lively and dynamic to maintain engagement. Use realia or images to reinforce vocabulary.     |
| **Preparation**                  | 15 mins | In pairs, students plan a 2-minute presentation about a healthy lifestyle choice or trend. Provide students with graphic organizers to outline their ideas and sentence starters to support their speech. Encourage them to use vocabulary from the lesson. This preparatory stage allows students to creatively explore the topic, organize information logically, and focus on clear pronunciation and coherent structuring of thoughts. Circulate to provide guidance and scaffolding, clarifying any confusion and checking for inclusion of targeted language.                         | Provide positive reinforcement and gentle correction.                                                      |
| **Complete Task**                | 35 mins | Students present their chosen health topic to the class in pairs. After each presentation, open the floor for questions and encourage peer feedback. Facilitate an engaging question-and-answer session by modeling how to ask insightful questions and demonstrate positive peer feedback methods. By providing a supportive audience, students can practice not only their speaking skills but also active listening and respectful interaction. Encourage spontaneity and flexibility in language use, reinforcing fluency and conversational skills.                                    | Ensure everyone gets a chance to present. Moderate the feedback session to maintain a positive tone.        |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**    | 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback based on observations during the presentations. Focus on three main areas: vocabulary use, grammar accuracy particularly with modals, and pronunciation. Use the board to demonstrate common errors and conduct mini-drills on pronunciation or sentence structure if necessary. Praise successful language usage, emphasizing improvement and effort. Offer personalized feedback to motivate individual progress, and facilitate group reflection to encourage peer support and collective learning.                                          | Prioritize clarity and encouragement in feedback.                                                          |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**             | 5 mins  | Address any remaining questions or topics that emerged during the lesson that need further discussion. Use this time to ensure all doubts are clarified and consolidate learned vocabulary or concepts. If extra time, play a quick review game or have a short discussion on a related topic to further solidify the lesson content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Be flexible and responsive to students’ needs.                                                            |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide language support for less confident speakers through sentence frames and visual aids. Offer extension tasks for advanced learners to explore more complex aspects of health and wellness.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may over-rely on native language translation – encourage thinking in English through targeted questioning and prompting.
- **Classroom Management:** Engage students actively with varying interaction patterns (pair work, group work) to minimize teacher talk.
