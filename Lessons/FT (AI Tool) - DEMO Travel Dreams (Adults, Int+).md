|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                     | 10 mins | Begin with a quick interaction where students share their dream travel destinations in pairs. Encourage them to describe why they chose this place briefly. This builds rapport and activates interest. | Make it personal and informal to reduce anxiety. Encourage students to ask questions about each other's choices.                                                                              |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins | Display various images of famous landmarks from around the world. Ask students to guess which country they are associated with. Transition into a discussion about travel experiences and aspirations. | Use visual aids and ensure a variety of countries are represented to cater to diverse interests.                                                                                             |
| Present Model              | 15 mins | Play a short video clip of a travel blogger discussing their trip to a particular country—focus on highlighting the language used to describe experiences and compare places. Have students note down useful phrases. | Ensure students have a clear task for while they're listening: noting useful phrases and language used for comparisons. Pose reflective questions post-viewing.                             |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins | Conduct a competitive game: "Travel Vocabulary Bingo." Present new vocabulary related to travel and cultural elements, students fill out Bingo cards with new words. Call out definitions; students mark their cards. | Provide support with sentence starters and visual aids. Pause the game intermittently to explain new vocabulary and check comprehension.                                                      |
| Preparation                | 15 mins | In groups, students choose a country and prepare a short presentation highlighting what one could see and do there. Prompt them to include a comparison to another country. Use graphic organizers to arrange ideas. | Model an example presentation and offer scaffolds like sentence frames. Provide feedback and guide students on how to structure information logically.                                        |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins | Organize a "Travel Debate": Each group presents their chosen country, highlighting its unique elements and why it's the best destination compared to others. Encourage debate and questioning from other groups. | Manage the time effectively, ensuring each group has equal opportunity. Promote respectful interaction and encourage quieter students to participate more actively.                         |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins | Provide class-wide feedback, focusing first on strengths in content and delivery, then gently highlight common errors, particularly in comparative language and pronunciation. Use examples from the presentations. | Utilize a positive feedback model: start with strengths, then address areas for improvement. Use examples from student work. Involve students in self-correction where possible.              |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)| 5 mins  | Allow students to ask any lingering questions about the topic or language, or to discuss travel goals and further inquiries in pairs. Use this as an opportunity to personalize the interaction based on students' interests. | Retain flexibility in addressing any emergent questions or interests. Keep interaction student-centered and facilitated through probing questions.                                             |
