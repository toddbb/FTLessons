### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                         | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Instruction Tips |
|-------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Warmer                        | 10 min | Begin with a short icebreaker game: "Two Truths and a Lie" related to past interview experiences. Each student shares two true experiences and one that is false, and classmates guess which is the lie. This activity builds rapport and highlights the theme of self-presentation in interviews. Use this opportunity to observe the students’ speaking styles and comfort levels.                                                                                                         | Encourage students to be creative but also reflective on their past interview experiences. |
| Lead-In / Set Context          | 10 min | Introduce the topic by discussing the importance of interview skills in both academic and job settings. Show a short video clip of a professional interview. Ask students to identify key components of a successful interview such as clarity, confidence, and appropriate language. Discuss their findings and write down key points on the board to activate prior knowledge.                                                                                                           | Highlight the significance of cultural norms in interview settings. |
| Present Model                 | 15 min | Present audio recordings of two contrasting interviews: one effective, one ineffective. Students listen and note differences in language use, confidence, and clarity. Guide students to use a T-chart to categorize effective and ineffective strategies. Follow with a class discussion on their observations, prompting them to reflect on why certain strategies work. This student-centered approach encourages active listening and critical analysis.                                    | Utilize pauses in the recording to allow students to catch up with note-taking. |
| Useful Language               | 15 min | Introduce a "Role-Play Interview" game where students pick cards with different interview roles and questions. Pre-teach key vocabulary and phrases through a matching activity: match interview terms with definitions. Model responses to sample interview questions using sentence starters and visual aids. Students practice in pairs, taking turns in role-play, promoting interaction and lowering the affective filter for language retention.                                                   | Use concept-checking questions to ensure understanding of new vocabulary. |
| Preparation                   | 15 min | In pairs, students plan for a mock interview using a graphic organizer. One student assumes the interviewer role and the other the interviewee role. They draft possible questions and responses, focusing on personal experiences and strengths. Encourage students to incorporate vocabulary from the previous activity and utilize provided sentence starters. Gradually release teacher support, moving from guided practice to more independent work.                                                 | Monitor pairs closely, providing scaffolded assistance when necessary. |
| Complete Task                 | 35 min | Conduct the mock interviews. Divide students into small groups, with one student as the interviewer and the others as interviewees. Encourage participants to ask follow-up questions and expand on answers. Rotate roles to ensure each student practices both asking and answering questions. Utilize formative assessment techniques, such as peer feedback, to provide constructive insights. This stage is critical for developing fluency and confidence in a realistic context.                     | Time each interview to keep the activity paced and engaging. |
| Feedback/Error Correction     | 15 min | Provide constructive feedback focusing on language accuracy, fluency, and pronunciation. Use examples from the mock interviews to highlight areas of strength and suggest improvements. Encourage self-assessment by having students reflect on their performance. Conclude with a mini-quiz to reinforce the day’s vocabulary. This stage helps students internalize key language points and fosters a supportive learning environment.                                                        | Focus on positive reinforcement to encourage continued engagement. |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)   | 5 min  | Address any remaining student questions or concerns, offer extension activities for fast finishers, or recap the vocabulary and strategies covered. This time can also be used for additional practice based on students’ emerging needs. Ensuring flexibility ensures students leave the lesson with a clear understanding, ready to apply skills in real-life situations.                                                                                                     | Adapt activities according to student needs. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation strategies: Pair stronger speakers with those needing more support for effective peer learning.
- Common pitfalls: Students may struggle with pronunciation or finding the right words to express experiences; be patient and provide extra practice.
- Classroom management: Establish clear rules for mock interviews to ensure respect and constructive feedback.
