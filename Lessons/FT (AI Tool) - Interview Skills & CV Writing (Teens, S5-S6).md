| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Begin with a lively game of "Job Bingo." Prepare bingo cards featuring different job titles and responsibilities. Students move around the room asking peers questions to find someone who matches each description. When a student completes their card, they shout "Bingo!" This energizes students and introduces job vocabulary playfully.                                                 | Use the bingo game to encourage interaction. Keep the pace lively and fun, ensuring students circulate and communicate. Highlight any common vocabulary issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Introduce the topic by asking students about the purpose of a CV. Engage students in a brief discussion by showing two contrasting CV examples (good vs bad). Ask students to identify key differences. This sets context and prompts critical thinking about CV content and presentation.                                                                                    | Display the CV examples on the projector. Encourage participation by asking prompting questions like, "What catches your eye?" or "What could be improved here?" to emphasize the importance of presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Show a sample model CV and discuss its sections: Personal Information, Objective, Experience, Education, Skills, and Achievements. Conduct a matching activity where students associate vocabulary terms with CV sections, fostering understanding. Play a short video of a mock job interview and let students identify positive interview behaviors. This reinforces real-world applicability.     | Have students work in pairs for the matching activity to ensure peer collaboration. This stage requires students listening for specific information in the video, so emphasize taking brief notes on the positive behaviors they see.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Engage students in a "CV Scramble" game. Provide students with cut-up example CV statements. In pairs, students must rearrange the words to form coherent sentences relevant to achievements or skills, promoting language accuracy. This activity also reinforces the importance of word order and context in professional language use.                                      | Circulate and monitor during the activity, offering help and praising correct arrangements. Use visual aids for additional support, showing how statements should be typically structured within different CV sections.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Divide students into small groups and provide each with a case study of a different candidate. Each group plans a CV for their candidate using a graphic organizer. Groups then present their candidate's experience, skills, and career goals in a mock interview setting. This reinforces detailed planning and clearly articulating information.                                              | Encourage students to use sentence starters like "My experience in..." for cohesive articulation. Offer formative assessment through feedback and guide students to use the graphic organizer effectively. Scaffold by providing prompts about what to include in each CV section.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Students choose a real or imagined job and create their own CV using digital tools or apps. They then role-play interviews where classmates ask and answer questions based on the CVs, emphasizing fluency and spontaneous interaction. This task enables students to practice fluent speaking, integrating all learned elements into a comprehensive exercise.                                     | Reduce teacher talk by encouraging student-centered communication. Provide prompts for interviewer questions to guide the role-play. Conduct regular comprehension checks by observing and intervening as needed. Encourage students to expand on their answers, offering a combination of feedback and positive reinforcement to boost confidence.                                                                                                   |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Facilitate a group reflection session. Elicit feedback on strengths and areas for improvement in both CV writing and speaking activities. Employ constructive feedback by highlighting strong examples and suggesting improvements. Emphasize the importance of clear communication and presentation in both written and spoken contexts.                                                      | Encourage self and peer assessment practices by asking questions like, "What did you do well today?" and "What is one thing you could improve for next time?" Model constructive feedback language and ensure the atmosphere is supportive and positive. Use this stage to clarify any language areas still needing attention by providing specific examples.                                                                                 |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Allow extra time for any outstanding questions or further practice of the skills covered in the lesson. Address any emergent needs students might have regarding CV writing or speaking practice.                                                                                                                                | Utilize this time flexibly, providing support where needed. Encourage students to ask any lingering questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
