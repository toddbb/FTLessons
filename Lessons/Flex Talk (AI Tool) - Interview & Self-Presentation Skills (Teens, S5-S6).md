### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                          | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                         | Instruction Tips                                          |
|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                     | 10 mins| Begin with a game of "Two Truths and a Lie." Each student writes down two true facts and one lie about themselves. They take turns sharing, while classmates guess which statement is false. This game serves to engage students immediately, build rapport, and introduce them to speaking about personal experiences. Provide examples to start, offering sentence frames like "I have..." or "I am..." to guide students. Ensure all students participate by using prompts and follow-up questions. | Encourage students to ask each other questions to guess the lie. Provide examples if necessary. Check understanding by listening to few examples and correcting any confusion about truths and lies. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**      | 10 mins| Play a short video clip of a simple job interview. Ask students to list what skills and qualities they notice in the candidate. This visually engaging context sets the scene for discussing interviews and self-presentation. Use a quick discussion after to activate prior knowledge about interviews, using guiding questions like "What did you notice about the interviewee’s body language?" and "How did the interviewee introduce themselves?" Encourage initial responses to be shared with partners to reduce speaking anxiety.  | Ensure accessibility of video content through clear audio and visuals. Post-video, reinforce vocabulary and qualities highlighted in the interview. Use questioning to personalize learning experiences. |
| **Present Model**              | 15 mins| Have students listen to an audio recording of a model interview. Provide them with a transcript containing the interviewer’s questions and leave blanks for the interviewee’s answers. In pairs, students predict possible answers based on the questions. Then, they listen again to complete the transcript. This guided listening activity helps students focus on typical structures and phrases used in interviews. Emphasize peer discussion for filling in blanks to enhance collaborative learning. Contributions from each student pair can be shared with the entire class to allow peer correction and validation. | Play the audio more than once if needed, each time with a different focus: first for gist, then for language forms. Monitor pairs and offer help where necessary to ensure engagement. Encourage student summaries of key points from the model. |
| **Useful Language**            | 15 mins| Conduct a flashcard game where students match questions with likely responses. Each card has either a question or a response. Students must walk around pairing questions with the correct answers. This kinetic game encourages movement and interaction, reinforcing language forms and structures pertinent to interviews. To scaffold learning, teacher modeling of a question-response pair is crucial initially. Offer sentence starters on the board such as “Could you tell me…?” and “I have experience in…” to support initial engagement and accuracy in pairing. | Adjust support based on real-time formative assessments. Group students strategically to support peer tutoring, balancing differing proficiency levels. Repeat the activity using different cards if needed to reinforce learning. |
| **Preparation**                | 15 mins| Provide students with a list of common interview questions. In pairs or small groups, students draft responses, focusing on confident language and clarity. Encourage role play and peer feedback, emphasizing the use of vocabulary from the Useful Language stage. This preparation task offers students ample opportunities to refine their responses and experiment with delivery. Encourage the use of visual prompts and mind maps for organizing ideas and aligning them with potential semantic areas. Regular teacher monitoring can provide timely feedback and re-direction. | Incorporate student preferences into role-play scenarios to personalize learning. Ensure that students understand expectations through modeling and questioning. Provide checklists for students to self-monitor language use. |
| **Complete Task**              | 35 mins| Students perform a full mock interview in a fishbowl format (one pair performs while others observe), using prompts from earlier stages. The interviewer and interviewee switch roles halfway through. Observing students provide feedback, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement. This high-stakes role-play activity fosters fluency and reinforces learning, integrating language and cultural components. Before initiating role-play, pre-teach any remaining critical vocabulary. Post-task feedback should be embedded, allowing students to critically evaluate peer performances, discussing aspects like tone, vocabulary, and clarity. Opportunities for individual reflections will solidify learning and reflections. | Minimize teacher talk by letting students lead the feedback conversation. Maintain a safe, non-judgmental environment. Offer positive reinforcement and scaffold improvement areas using student-generated insights. Facilitate group discussions post-task to analyze the practical application of skills. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**   | 15 mins| Conduct a group error correction session using examples from the role-plays. Write anonymous sentences on the board; students work in groups to correct and identify the nature of each mistake. Incorporate a competitive element by rewarding groups that identify errors correctly. Foster a supportive environment where students are encouraged to analyze language critically, transforming errors into learning moments. To facilitate the process, offer correction models and language forms identified during the Present Model stage. Encourage metacognitive strategies during correction activities. | Focus feedback on both language and presentation skills. Discuss common errors and provide strategies for improvement, promoting learner autonomy. Ensure peer corrections are respectful and constructive. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**           | 5 mins | Allocate this time for addressing emergent language issues, answering additional questions, or repeating any necessary activity to ensure comprehension and comfort with content. Flexibility here supports personalized educational needs, facilitating a highly adaptive classroom dynamic. Be ready with additional prompts or clarification materials to utilize effectively based on student needs determined through continuous formative assessment. | Tailor flex time to student needs; allow for Q&A or a repeat of any activity if students seem unclear or need reinforcement. Enable contributions from quieter students by inviting individual questions. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Pair stronger and weaker students for peer support.
- Encourage students to make connections between their own experiences and the interview task.
- Use visual aids and multimedia to support diverse learning styles.
- Regularly check comprehension and provide immediate corrective feedback where necessary.
- Foster a community atmosphere where students feel comfortable to experiment with language.
