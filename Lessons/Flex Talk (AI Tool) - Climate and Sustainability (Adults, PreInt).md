## Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                  | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Begin with a quick quiz about the students' personal habits related to sustainability (e.g., recycling, using reusable bags). Ask students to stand up if they perform certain activities. This kinesthetic activity energizes the class and sets a personal tone for the topic. The teacher will observe and encourage interaction. | Use simple yes/no questions to ensure accessibility. For instance, "Do you recycle regularly?" and "Do you use public transportation?"                                                                                                                             |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Play an audio clip of a news segment about recent climate events. Ask students to take notes on key points. After listening, form small groups to share what they understood. Students discuss how these events relate to their own experiences. Encourage personal connections to the topic.                                  | Use visual aids or keywords on the board to support listening comprehension. Pause the audio if necessary to emphasize important points.                                                                                                                            |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Provide students with an article about innovative sustainability solutions. After reading, ask students to identify key vocabulary and structures related to suggestions (e.g., "We should..."). Highlight sentences using modal verbs. Students work in pairs to discuss and highlight sentences, fostering peer support.               | Circulate to provide assistance and model how to identify modal verbs and relevant phrases. Ask comprehension check questions to ensure understanding.                                                                                                              |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Play a game using an online quiz platform where students match environmental issues with appropriate sustainability solutions. Each question includes an image and keywords to reinforce learning. The competitive aspect encourages engagement and reinforces vocabulary through repetition and contextual application.          | Include a short demonstration of how the game works. Provide immediate feedback and praise to maintain motivation. Ensure vocabulary items are pronounced clearly for repetition.                                                                                  |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | In groups, students plan a short presentation on a sustainability initiative they find interesting. Provide a graphic organizer to help structure their ideas (introduction, problem, solution, benefits). Use sentence starters to support their planning. This scaffolding builds confidence before production.                 | Provide examples of easy-to-create presentations. Encourage students to incorporate vocabulary from earlier activities. Rotate among groups to provide support and feedback.                                                                                       |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Each group presents their sustainability initiative. Encourage classmates to ask questions and offer suggestions using modal verbs (e.g., "You should consider...", "Why don't you...?"). Focus on fluency and effective communication. The teacher observes, takes notes, and provides feedback based on observations.                       | Encourage active listening by asking the audience to prepare a question. Limit teacher talk to allow maximum student production. Use a timer to keep presentations concise and to ensure each group has equal time.                                                                                        |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins  | Provide constructive feedback on students' presentations. Highlight effective use of vocabulary and grammar. Address common errors with modal verbs and pronunciation. Use student work to correct mistakes and illustrate learning points, promoting awareness through direct examples, enhancing retention and comprehension. | Use a positive approach focusing on improvements and strengths. Present corrections in context to aid understanding. Incorporate peer feedback where appropriate to foster a supportive learning environment.                                                                 |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Allow time for any additional questions or a brief discussion on students' feelings about learning and discussing climate change. This time can be used to wrap up loose ends or dive deeper into any of the lesson's topics, ensuring that all students feel comfortable and confident with the subject matter.                      | Be ready to adjust based on student needs. Encourage students to reflect on their learning. Address any outstanding questions.                                                                                                                                      |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Use visuals and videos for visual learners. Provide additional reading materials for advanced students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for confusion between similar vocabulary items (e.g., climate vs. weather). Reinforce through examples.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure even participation by encouraging quieter students to share opinions.
