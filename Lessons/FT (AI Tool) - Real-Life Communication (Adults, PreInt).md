|---------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins | The lesson begins with a fast-paced game called "Conflict Ball". Students form a circle. A soft ball is tossed around, and when a student catches it, they must quickly state a word or phrase they associate with conflict (e.g., disagreement, tension). This will activate learners’ prior knowledge and familiarize them with vocabulary they may hear throughout the lesson. Pre-teach essential vocabulary, using the board to display the words and provide example sentences. The game encourages engagement and sets a lively tone for the class.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Encourage students to think quickly. Allow for repeated vocabulary to build comfort. Use the board to contrast correct and incorrect examples.                                            |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Transition to a brief discussion on common conflicts students face in real life. Use prompt questions like, "Have you ever disagreed with a friend?" or "How do you usually solve disagreements at work?" Use visual aids or a short video clip depicting a conflict (without audio) as students note down non-verbal communication cues. Have students pair up to share their observations and discuss how they think the conflict might develop. Use this context to set the stage for understanding conflict resolution techniques and ensure comprehension by asking key questions.                                                                                                                                     | Use open body language to encourage sharing. Use comprehension checks by asking students to summarize their partner's ideas.                                                              |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins | Introduce an audio clip of a conflict scenario between two friends trying to decide where to go for dinner. Students listen to the clip twice. The first time, students identify the main issue. The second time, students focus on how each person expresses their point of view. After listening, present a written transcript on screen. Highlight key phrases used for expressing concerns and offering solutions. Facilitate a group discussion on effective expressions and approaches. Ask students to underline modal verbs that express advice and suggestions in the transcript and discuss their function.                                                | Ensure the transcript is clear and visible. Facilitate peer discussions and highlight differing interpretations to enrich understanding.                                                    |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins | Engage students in a word association game to review vocabulary, using flashcards that have conflict resolution terms. Each flashcard has a word, definition, and example. Students take turns drawing and defining the terms with their partners, using it in a sentence. The game encourages playful competition while fostering vocabulary retention. Introduce sentence starters for giving advice (e.g., "You should...", "Maybe you could..."), and emphasize how word stress and tone convey empathy. Monitor interactions to ensure accurate usage.                                                                                                                                                        | Use supportive prompts to encourage hesitant students. Monitor pairs to ensure vocabulary use. Offer praise for creativity in sentences.                                                     |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins | In small groups, students receive role-play cards that describe different conflict scenarios. Each student takes a turn playing a mediator, trying to help the other two resolve a disagreement by applying phrases and strategies discussed earlier. Give students time to plan their approach, using graphic organizers to jot down key points and strategies they'll employ. Provide scaffolding with sentence starters and prompts. Rotate between groups to provide formative feedback. Encourage students to consider both sides of the argument while remaining neutral in the discussion. Ensure students know this stage is non-judgmental practice for fluency and confidence building.       | Provide structured time limits for each role-play to ensure smooth transitions. Use strategic questioning to challenge deeper thinking. Offer specific praise and encourage reflection.        |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins | Students embark on a collaborative task where they must apply their learning to resolve a scripted disagreement. Each group receives a comprehensive scenario involving workplace conflict. The objective is to mediate the dispute, using effective language strategies practiced. Encourage dynamic interaction, stressing the authentic use of language over form perfection. Throughout, circulate to subtly monitor, noting both accurate usage and common errors. Students should list proposed solutions, choosing the one that seems most equitable. Ending with a reflective group discussion to compare the mediation approaches, ensuring understanding and genuine application of the learned conflict techniques.                              | Create an atmosphere that encourages authentic language usage by celebrating both attempts and successes. Ensure reflection time is constructive through guiding questions.                 |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide targeted feedback on students' language use during the task. Initiate with whole-class positive highlights where effective techniques were noticed, illustrating with phrases students used. Transition into focused corrections of prevalent errors identified, using a board for clarification. Address pronunciation concerns, specifically stress patterns. Encourage students to reflect on alternative language expressions through gentle Socratic questioning. Offer students an opportunity to self-correct or rephrase errors, solidifying learning. Provide additional resource recommendations for further practice outside the classroom. Solidify with homework prompts for skill reinforcement.         | Maintain a supportive and motivating tone. Focus error correction on common issues without overwhelming students. Encourage self-reflection and independent learning growth.                  |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**     | 5 mins  | Allow time to address any emergent questions or concerns from students regarding conflict resolution scenarios or language usage. Use this time adaptively to consolidate learning, offer one-on-one support, or initiate additional practice if needed. This flexible time can also serve as a recap on lesson highlights or a short Q&A session, ensuring all students depart with clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Be observant of the class atmosphere; tailor flex-time based on collective energy and needs. Encourage students to be proactive in seeking clarification.                                  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Use mixed-ability groupings to provide peer support. Encourage stronger students to take lead roles initially.
- Common Pitfalls: Students may struggle with indirect language; model examples and practice through repetition. Address hesitation by creating a supportive environment.
- Classroom Management: Clearly outline the structure of role-play activities. Monitor group dynamics to ensure all voices are heard.
