|-------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                        | 10 mins    | Begin with a light-hearted game called "Health Bingo." Distribute bingo cards featuring a variety of health-related activities (e.g., jogging, yoga, meditation). Students mingle to find classmates who practice these activities, writing names down. The first student to complete their card shouts "Bingo!" Ask winners to share three most interesting facts they learned. This energizes the class and encourages interaction. | Encourage mingling by demonstrating how to politely ask others about their activities. Give an example to guide students in connecting with peers.                                                                                                       |
| Lead-In / Set Context         | 10 mins    | Play a short video featuring current fitness trends. After watching, initiate a pair discussion with questions like "Which trend do you find most interesting?" and "Would you try any?" Circulate to listen and support where needed. Conclude with a whole-class discussion, summarizing key points shared. Establishes context and activates prior knowledge about health and fitness.                                                      | Use visual aids to highlight key trends from the video. Encourage all students to participate by asking open-ended questions.                                                                                                                            |
| Present Model                 | 15 mins    | Introduce a dialogue between two friends discussing their health plans, highlighting expressions like "I'm trying to," "I've started to," "It helps me stay," etc. Students follow along, identifying these phrases and their usage. Use role-play where students practice the dialogue in pairs, then experiment by creating similar exchanges on different health topics, ensuring student-centered engagement.                      | Provide sentence starters on the board. Encourage creativity in crafting dialogues by showing enthusiasm and providing constructive feedback.                                                                                                           |
| Useful Language               | 15 mins    | Play "Word Association Relay," a competitive game. Divide class into teams. Call out a health-related word, and teams race to list related words within a minute. Review words, providing meanings, pronunciation tips, and examples. Reinforce understanding through repetition and context. Concludes with a sharing session where students create sentences using new vocabulary, enhancing language accuracy.                       | Scaffold learning by giving examples of word associations first. Encourage learners to think critically about connections between vocabulary terms.                                                                                                      |
| Preparation                   | 15 mins    | Students individually brainstorm topics related to personal health and wellness they are passionate about. Use graphic organizers to outline their thoughts and gather relevant vocabulary. Then, in pairs, they share and refine ideas, receiving peer feedback. This period is vital to structure their upcoming speaking task, building confidence through planning and collaboration.                                           | Offer assistance by circulating and providing formative feedback. Encourage the use of peer support to build a supportive speaking environment.                                                                                                          |
| Complete Task                 | 35 mins    | Execute a "Wellness Fair" activity, where students create mini-presentations on chosen health topics. Peers visit "booths," listening and engaging in discussions about each presentation. Students rotate to ensure everyone presents to various classmates. Throughout, encourage spontaneous conversation, emphasizing fluency and holistic communication. Follow up with peer feedback, focusing on strengths and areas for growth.                        | Model how to start a presentation and ask questions. Use formative assessment checkpoints: "Tell me more about...", ensuring students deeply engage with the content.                                                                                   |
| Feedback/Error Correction     | 15 mins    | Conduct a feedback session. Highlight common language errors noted during the wellness fair, writing them on the board with corrections. Discuss strategies to avoid similar mistakes. Elicit positive feedback from students about their experiences, reinforcing the value of peer input. Balance correction with praise to foster a supportive atmosphere for continued language development.                    | Use sandwich feedback: start with positive observation, discuss errors, conclude with encouragement. Encourage students to reflect on improvements in fluency and confidence.                                                                            |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)   | 5 mins     | Address any emergent questions or engage in a brief wrap-up activity like discussing a surprise fitness fact. Provides flexibility to cater to class needs, allowing time for one-on-one support or brief reflections on the lesson's content.                                                                                                                                            | Prepare a few extra activities or interesting health facts. Use this time to answer individual student questions or concerns.                                                                                                                           |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing more support. Use visuals to support understanding. Provide sentence frames for those needing extra guidance.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may focus more on vocabulary than fluency. Encourage balance by reminding them of communication goals.
- **Classroom Management:** Keep activities dynamic and varied to maintain engagement. Use movement-based tasks to reset energy levels when needed.
