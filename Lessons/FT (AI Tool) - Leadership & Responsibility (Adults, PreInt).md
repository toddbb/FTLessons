| Stage                     | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                               | Instruction Tips                                            |
|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                    | 10 mins| Begin with a quick brainstorming session where students discuss leaders they admire. Ask them to state qualities they find admirable. Pair students to share their thoughts and create a mind map on the board collectively. This fosters a relaxed atmosphere and sets the stage for participatory learning as it encourages reflection on leadership qualities. | Encourage open discussion and validate diverse opinions. |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins| Present a short video or audio clip of a famous leader speaking. Ask students to focus on identifying key responsibilities mentioned by the leader. Pause occasionally to check comprehension and discuss any unfamiliar vocabulary, which will activate students' schemata and provide authentic context for language use through visual and auditory input. | Pre-teach vocabulary, prompt students with guiding questions, and scaffold understanding by highlighting specific details. |
| Present Model             | 15 mins| Organize a role-play activity where a scenario is presented: “You are in charge of planning a community event but face several challenges.” Use a script to model potential leader dialogues, demonstrating effective responsibility communication. Students should identify modal verbs and leadership language used effectively. Through active observation and participation, learners deduce how language operates within leadership frameworks. This aids in internalizing structural and function language relevant to leadership scenarios. | Use board examples, ensure clarity on modal usage, and provide sentence starters to support language. |
| Useful Language           | 15 mins| Introduce a game-based activity (Vocabulary Bingo) involving key leadership vocabulary. Students will have bingo cards with words and on calling out definitions, they mark the corresponding words. This interactive game experience helps solidify vocabulary recognition and understanding through an engaging involvement. | Keep pace lively, and offer immediate feedback. Introduce synonyms or examples for clarification. |
| Preparation               | 15 mins| Divide the class into groups for a decision-making task: “Your organization needs to decide on a charity project to support.” They must decide which project to support, considering various impacts. Assign roles (leader, secretary, presenter) and aid in setting clear roles and expectations. Peer support initiates teamwork and prepares them for independent execution. | Guide grouping to ensure diverse teams. Monitor contributions and prompt with critical thinking questions. |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins| Groups conduct the decision-making task, utilizing leadership language and strategies. Encourage spontaneous, meaningful interaction as groups present their decisions, justifying their choices and demonstrating the language of negotiation, compromise, and leadership. Feedback is peer-centered to enhance involvement. Hang posters with decision summaries to facilitate peer feedback. | Rotate and support groups, encouraging peer evaluation. Manage time effectively so each group has the opportunity to showcase work. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins| Conduct a debriefing session, inviting groups to share highlights and challenges they faced. Offer constructive feedback on pronunciation, vocabulary usage, and clarity of expression. Positive reinforcement is followed by discussing common errors and areas for improvement, fostering an environment where students view feedback as a tool for growth. | Use error correction techniques like reformation. Offer personalized feedback. Encourage reflection on progress. |
| Flex-time/Buffer          | 5 mins | Allow time for clarifying doubts or questions. Facilitate an open discussion about real-world applications of the leadership concepts explored, encouraging learners to relate the classroom activities to real or hypothetical scenarios in their own lives, reinforcing the practical value of language and skills acquired. | Be open to unstructured conversation. Ensure learners understand they can apply concepts outside the classroom. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation:** Mix proficiency levels within groups to promote peer teaching. Adjust complexity of texts/audio for higher-level groups.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure clear instructions for interactive activities to avoid misunderstandings. Focus also on respecting turn-taking in discussions.
- **Classroom Management:** Rotate amongst groups to distribute attention evenly. Use non-verbal cues to manage noise and maintain engagement.
