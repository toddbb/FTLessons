### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                  | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Begin with a brainstorm on the board. Ask students to name their favorite social media platforms. Transition into a quick game of "Social Media Bingo" where students circulate, finding classmates who use different platforms, noting down names. This helps break the ice and bring energy into the class. Encourage sharing personal experiences and why they prefer certain platforms.                                            | Use visuals for platform logos. Ensure students ask at least two follow-up questions to each classmate to promote interaction. Keep teacher talk minimal by encouraging students to engage with as many classmates as possible.                                                                 |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Show a video clip showcasing different social media trends. Organize a quick chat buzz where students, in pairs, share one recent trend they found interesting. This activity assesses prior knowledge and sets context. Support with a graphic organizer for students to fill out, noting trend names and platforms. Check comprehension through summarization exercises with their partner, ensuring equal turns in speaking.             | Use pause points during the video for additional explanations if necessary. Use targeted questions like, "What trend did you find the most surprising and why?" to deepen discussions.                                                                                      |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Distribute example screenshots of social media posts in groups. Assign each group a platform and ask them to identify which platform’s characteristics match their examples. Have groups present their findings briefly. Follow up with a group discussion on the language used in these posts. This activity models authentic language use while allowing students to discover characteristics through guided inquiry.                     | Model an example yourself first. Offer sentence stems like "This post shows..." or "The language indicates..." to support lower proficiency students. Rotate around groups to provide real-time feedback, keeping students on task and supporting as needed.                     |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Facilitate a "Social Media Vocabulary Relay" game. Create two teams. Show a social media term, and teams race to write definitions and example sentences on the board. Points are awarded for correct usage in context. Use a list of vocabulary words adapted to their CEFR level. This reinforces understanding and ensures active participation.                                                                                           | Pre-teach tricky vocabulary using flashcards. Include readings of each word for pronunciation practice. Emphasize time efficiency to keep energy high. Prompt team discussions on how terms are used in real examples.                                                       |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Students prepare a short group presentation about a social media trend of their choice. Provide a structure with which to describe the trend, its platform, and its impact. Offer a list of comparative structures they can use (e.g., "more popular than", "as engaging as"). Check for adherence to the structure and language accuracy. Provide sentence starters and graphic organizers to assist their planning.                                                 | Provide sentence frames for more complex comparisons. Use peer editing before presentations for additional feedback. Rotate among groups to check each team is on track and using language accurately. Allow brief group consultation with you if needed.                    |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Conduct a "Social Media Summit", where groups present their findings. Encourage other students to ask questions and provide peer feedback on each presentation. Use a peer feedback form with specific criteria (content relevance, language use, fluency). This encourages active listening and assessment skills. Scaffold with stems for expressing agreement or giving opinions during the Q&A session after each presentation.              | Limit teacher feedback during presentations to keep student interaction the focus. Use scaffolded sentence stems such as "I agree because..." and "One suggestion I have is..." Post criteria visibly so students know focus areas. Rotate seating to stimulate new conversations. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Offer feedback on language and content errors post-task. Highlight successful language, giving examples. Address common language issues from the summit, correcting them in a supportive manner. Use visual aids to display correct language patterns. Engage in a brief reflective session where students share what they learned and their takeaways from peers. Reinforce language structures experienced during the lesson.                  | Use positive feedback strategies focusing on specific language and content successes. Frame corrections within student contributions, promoting a positive classroom atmosphere. Encourage students to note down at least one actionable language target for improvement.           |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Respond to emergent questions or finish any unfinished tasks. Offer a quick quiz using Kahoot to reinforce vocabulary from the lesson in a fun and interactive manner. This review strengthens retention and reinforces the game-based learning approach intrinsic to the lesson.                                                                                                           | Use this time flexibly. Keep interactions student-centered, possibly having students create their own Kahoot questions in pairs. Ensure balance between challenge and review.                                                                                                                                      |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies**: Pair more confident speakers with less confident ones, fostering peer learning.  
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid assuming all students are familiar with every social media trend. Provide visuals and examples as needed.  
- **Classroom Management**: Utilize a timer to ensure activities move at a brisk pace, avoiding lag that can disrupt energy. Rotate group configurations to encourage collaboration among different students.
