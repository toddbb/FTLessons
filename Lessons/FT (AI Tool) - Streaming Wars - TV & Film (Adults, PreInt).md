### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing  | Detailed Activity Description & Instructions                                           |
|------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins | Begin with a short activity where students discuss in pairs their favorite TV shows or films and whether they watch them on traditional TV or streaming services. Ask students to write the names of one show or film on the board. This will create instant engagement and interest. Use this information to introduce the concept of "Streaming Wars". |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins | Students watch short, engaging clips from two popular streaming services to compare them with a traditional TV advertisement. This visual input will set the context for discussing the evolution of media consumption. Encourage students to share immediate reactions to the differences they perceive. |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins | Provide students with a structured discussion model using comparative and superlative adjectives. For example, "Streaming platforms are more convenient than traditional TV because..." Model sentence frames to highlight how these structures work. Students listen to a short dialogue between two people discussing media preferences, and they have to note down comparative structures used. Allow students to practice these structures in pairs using their own media experiences. |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins | Conduct a vocabulary game called "Media Bingo". Provide students with a bingo card filled with terms related to streaming and traditional media. As the teacher calls out definitions, students must identify and mark the terms. This reinforces new vocabulary and encourages active participation. After the game, discuss any terms or language patterns that were challenging. |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins | Split students into small groups to brainstorm the advantages and disadvantages of streaming services versus traditional media. Provide a graphic organizer to help structure their ideas clearly. During this preparatory phase, circulate and provide scaffolding, ensuring students use vocabulary and comparative language effectively. Highlight language structures and common pitfalls as needed. |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins | In this task-focused activity, groups will present their analysis of the impact of streaming on traditional media to the class. Encourage the use of new vocabulary and sentence structures. Provide students with recording devices to document their presentations if possible. This can help in self-assessment later. Facilitate peer feedback by having listeners note one strength and one area for improvement for each presentation. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins | Provide a session of constructive feedback on students' presentations. Focus on pronunciation, grammar accuracy, and the use of comparative and superlative forms. Encourage peer feedback as well, asking students what they learned and which vocabulary or structures stood out. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins  | Provide additional support for students who might need more assistance with the vocabulary or language structures. Alternatively, use this time for a brief Q&A session where students can ask questions about the topic or language points. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer additional support with visual aids, sentence frames, or one-on-one discussions for students who struggle with vocabulary.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students understand the correct use of comparative and superlative forms, as these can often be confused.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain a focus on student interaction over teacher talk, encouraging peer collaboration and discussion.
