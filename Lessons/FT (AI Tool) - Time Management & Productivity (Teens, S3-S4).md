## Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| To start the class with energy, initiate a "Time Bomb" game. Students form a circle, passing a ball while music plays. When the music stops, the student holding the ball answers a question about their daily routine using learned vocabulary. This builds rapport and eases students into speaking activities.                                                           | Ensure the questions are simple and relevant, such as "What time do you usually wake up?" Encourage students to use full sentences. Create a positive atmosphere by cheering and clapping for correct answers.                             |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Display various images representing productivity (e.g., planners, clocks, a student studying, etc.). Engage students in predicting the lesson topic by asking guided questions like, "What do you see?" and "How do these things help us?" This contextualizes the topic and builds interest in time management and productivity strategies.                                      | Use props or visual aids to support comprehension. Encourage students to describe what they see in the images, scaffolding with sentence starters like "This picture shows...".                                                                                 |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Use a short, engaging story about a day in the life of "Sam," a student who manages time well. Provide a listening task where students tick off activities Sam does from a provided list. After listening, discuss the key strategies Sam used (e.g., making a list, setting priorities). This exemplifies the target language and structures in context.                                  | Model clear pronunciation for new vocabulary. Use gestures and stress intonation to highlight key words. Conduct comprehension checks by asking questions such as "What did Sam do at 7 AM?" and provide corrective feedback as needed.                             |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Transform the vocabulary practice into a competitive game, "Vocabulary Relay." Prepare flashcards with words and definitions mixed up. Divide the class into teams, and students take turns matching the correct cards under timed conditions. They must also use the word in a sentence to confirm understanding.                                              | Model the first example to demonstrate the activity. Use peer support by pairing stronger and weaker students. Monitor the groups, offering feedback and encouragement. Keep score to increase motivation and engagement.                                         |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| Students work in pairs to create a simple plan for a productive day, using a graphic organizer to map out activities and time allocations. Provide a checklist of activities to include and remind students to use target vocabulary and structures to discuss their schedules. This allows practice in structured planning.                                                   | Display a sample plan and model its discussion to scaffold student efforts. Use prompts like "In the morning, we should..." to help students articulate their plans accurately. Circulate and offer supportive feedback.                                         |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Conduct a "Time Management Expo." Each pair presents their daily plan to another pair, using a structured dialogue format. Encourage the use of modal verbs and target vocabulary. After exchanges, pairs rotate to demonstrate activities to new partners, enabling practice across multiple interactions, enhancing fluency, and promoting spontaneous speech.   | Provide sentence starters and visual aids as needed to aid less confident speakers. Use formative assessment to check understanding and note common errors for feedback later. Encourage peer-to-peer questions to extend dialogue.                             |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins| Conduct a Group Feedback session. Highlight common usage errors and elicit corrections from students. Celebrate successful communication strategies observed. Use examples from the "Expo" to address errors in vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation. Reinforce learning with collective praise and encourage students to reflect on their progress. | Use a balanced feedback approach, correcting errors with sensitivity. Encourage self-correction and peer correction to foster a supportive learning atmosphere. Conclude with a formative assessment quiz to gauge retention of content.                                 |
| Flex-time/Buffer             | 5 mins | Allow time for any remaining questions, reinforcing concepts, or addressing areas needing clarification. Use this time for impromptu speaking opportunities or to highlight particularly strong performances observed during the lesson.                                                                                                 | Invite volunteers to share insights or new things they learned about their own time management habits. Provide positive reinforcement and ensure every student leaves feeling successful and motivated to continue learning.                                    |

## Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Mix different proficiency levels in activities for peer support. Adapt materials for varied understanding, such as simplifying vocabulary for lower-level learners.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overcome potential misunderstandings regarding the abstract concept of "time management" by relating it to everyday student routines and responsibilities.
- **Classroom Management:** Use clear signals to transition between activities, maintain engagement by varying the pace and modes of interaction, and use praise to reinforce participation.
