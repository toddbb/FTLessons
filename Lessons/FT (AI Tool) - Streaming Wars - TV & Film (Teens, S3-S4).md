| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with an interactive discussion using a fun, competitive quiz game "Streaming Service Showdown." Divide the class into two teams and give them a quick-fire round of questions related to popular streaming platforms and traditional TV shows. Each correct answer earns a point. Keep track on the whiteboard to make it visually engaging. This not only builds rapport but energizes the room, creating a lively start. Encourage all students to think quickly and respond. Use friendly competition to break initial hesitation among peers. | Encourage quick responses, use visual prompts on the board, offer hints if needed. Limit teacher talk to facilitate maximum student interaction. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Activate students’ prior knowledge by discussing what they usually watch and how. Use a T-chart on the whiteboard to compare streaming services to traditional TV. Ask students about their preferences and guide the conversation. This primes students for the topic by connecting it to their personal experiences. Facilitate a brief discussion, offering prompts like, "Why do you prefer this?" or "How do you usually watch movies?" Keep the energy high, focusing on students sharing their experiences. | Use open-ended questions to stimulate discussion. Take notes on the board. Provide sentence starters like, "I prefer streaming because..." to support lower ability students. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Show a short video clip or infographic highlighting key differences between streaming and traditional services. Set a task for students to identify at least three differences mentioned. This task requires active listening and comprehension, promoting engagement with authentic material. Following the viewing, pair students to discuss their findings, ensuring that every student voices their observation. This collaborative approach fosters a deeper understanding. | Pre-teach vocabulary related to streaming. Use check questions during the viewing to ensure comprehension. Provide visual aids for support. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Play "Word Bingo" using vocabulary related to media consumption. Give each student a bingo card with words like "subscription," "binge-watch," and "influence." As you describe each word, students listen and mark their cards if the word is mentioned. The first to complete a line wins. This game reinforces vocabulary in an enjoyable, competitive manner. It provides necessary repetition and aids retention through listening and recognition. | Explain the rules clearly and use gestures for clarification. Encourage peer support for understanding definitions during the game. Offer example sentences for context. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | In small groups, students plan a short presentation about how streaming services influence media culture. Provide a graphic organizer to help structure ideas. Assign roles such as organizer, speaker, and note-taker. Students draw on language and ideas from previous activities to prepare content. Offer linguistic support and guide brainstorming but keep the teacher’s talk minimal. Check in regularly to assist with difficult points. | Use guiding questions like "What is the biggest change?" to stimulate thinking. Provide vocabulary lists and sentence starters. Ensure every student participates by mixing stronger and weaker students in each group. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Groups present their findings to the class. The audience has a checklist to tick when they hear specific key points about streaming vs. traditional media. This interactive listening task ensures students stay engaged. Allow time for questions after each presentation, promoting further dialogue. Correct language errors subtly and encourage peer-to-peer feedback. This stage emphasizes the use of new vocabulary and structures in a real-world context, increasing fluency and confidence. | Set clear expectations for both speakers and listeners. Encourage questions and support constructive feedback from peers. Use the board to highlight excellent language use or correct any common errors noticed. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Debrief as a whole class. Highlight strong points from presentations and provide corrective feedback where necessary. Use examples from student speeches to correct common errors related to grammar and pronunciation. Reinforce learning by echoing successful use of target language. This session promotes a positive learning atmosphere and reinforces self-awareness in language use. | Focus on positive reinforcement before corrective feedback. Use student examples to ensure corrections are personalized and relatable. Provide differentiation by offering challenge questions to advanced learners. |
