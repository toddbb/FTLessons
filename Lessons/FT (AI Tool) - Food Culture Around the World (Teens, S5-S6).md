| Stage                         | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                             | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins| Start with a fun quiz game, "Guess the Dish." Display images of various international dishes. Students, in groups, guess the name and origin of each dish. Encourage lively discussion as they debate answers, fostering an engaging environment. Use this opportunity to elicit any prior knowledge about the dishes, guiding students to make connections with their cultural backgrounds. Ensure participation by rotating speakers within each group, motivating all students to share their thoughts, and building rapport among new classmates.                               | Use visuals to support students with varying proficiency. Offer prompts like, "This dish looks like...". Emphasize correct pronunciation of dish names.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins| Show a short video showcasing diverse food cultures and rituals from around the world. As students watch, ask them to jot down specific dishes, countries, and customs they notice. Following the video, facilitate a brief class discussion where students share their observations. Guide them by asking, "What surprised you about the food culture shown?" or "Did you notice any similarities with your own culture?" This activity sets the context by highlighting the diversity and significance of food globally, engaging students in a topic with universal appeal. | Prepare students by modeling how to take notes. Ensure comprehension through follow-up questions and provide sentence starters ("I noticed that...," "I found it interesting that...").                                                                      |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins| Present a dialogue between two people discussing their favorite international cuisines. The dialogue includes comparative structures and expressions of preference. Assign roles to students and have them perform the dialogue in pairs. After acting out, hold a class discussion exploring the cultural significance of the dishes mentioned. Encourage students to think about what makes certain dishes popular or symbolic in different cultures, relating it back to their own experiences. Use this activity to model fluent conversation about food culture. | Highlight key expressions and structures on the board. Provide students with the transcript, emphasizing the pronunciation of key terms. Conduct a comprehension check with questions like, "Why does Character A prefer this cuisine?"                               |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins| Conduct a competitive vocabulary game, "Food Bingo." Provide bingo cards filled with food-related terms. As you call out definitions, students mark the corresponding word on their cards. To win, they must call out "Bingo!" and use each word in a sentence about food culture. This game reinforces vocabulary in an interactive and fun manner, ensuring students are engaged while learning crucial terms. Encourage peer interaction as students work together to decide if the definition matches a term on their card, promoting collaborative learning.       | Use visuals or synonyms to clarify definitions. Provide sentence starters for those struggling to form sentences. Circulate and assist students, ensuring each group is participating.                                                                                 |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins| In small groups, students prepare a short presentation about a chosen country's food culture. They research one iconic dish, its cultural significance, preparation, and any interesting customs related to it. Encourage them to use the new vocabulary and structures learned. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their presentations. Monitor and guide them, offering suggestions and language support. This stage helps students organize their ideas and rehearse using the target vocabulary in context, building confidence before the main task.                                  | Offer examples and model a mini-presentation. Use graphic organizers to aid logical structuring of ideas. Ensure each group member has a specific role, such as researcher, presenter, or note-taker, to promote equal participation.                          |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins| Students deliver their group presentations to the class. Encourage active listening by having the audience take notes on interesting points or any questions they have. Following each presentation, prompt the audience to ask questions, fostering a Q&A session. Guide students in giving constructive feedback, emphasizing both strengths and areas for improvement. This task enhances fluency through authentic communication while promoting a deeper understanding of global culinary traditions.                                           | Provide language support for the Q&A session, such as "Could you explain...?" or "I was fascinated by...". Encourage use of body language and voice modulation during presentations for effective communication.                                                      |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session focused on language use and presentation skills. Use positive reinforcement for effective communication and accurate vocabulary use. Address common errors in grammar or pronunciation observed during presentations. Provide examples and model corrections, involving students in self-correction and peer feedback. Encourage reflections by asking, "What did you learn about other cultures today?" or "How can you improve your presentation skills in the future?" Balance feedback with positive comments to boost confidence and motivation. | Use a checklist to track common errors and achievements during presentations. Focus on recurring mistakes and highlight them gently. Encourage students to self-assess using guiding questions to ensure they recognize their progress and areas needing improvement.     |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins | Allocate time for any emergent questions or additional student reflections. This time can be used to clarify any confusion, further discuss intriguing topics, or wrap up the lesson on a positive note.                                                                      | Allow students to voice queries in their first language if necessary, translating to ensure understanding. This helps accommodate all students and reinforces a supportive classroom environment.                                                                          |
