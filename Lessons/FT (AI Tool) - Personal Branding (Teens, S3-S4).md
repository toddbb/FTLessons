| Stage                   | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Warmer                  | 10 mins| Start with a simple game called "Name Bingo." Each student receives a bingo card with different strengths and personal traits written on it (e.g., creative, organized, helpful). Students mingle, asking questions like "Are you creative?" or "Are you organized?" to find classmates matching the traits. The aim is to find classmates to fill up the bingo card. This activity pre-teaches vocabulary in an engaging way and sets a positive, collaborative tone. Teacher circulates to provide assistance if needed. |
| Lead-In / Set Context   | 10 mins| Introduce the topic by asking students about famous people they admire and why. Show short video clips of professionals explaining their personal brands. Engage students in a short discussion about what makes someone stand out professionally and socially. This activates prior knowledge and sets the context for the lesson. Use prompting questions like, "What is a personal brand?" and "Why is it important?" Scaffold language with sentence starters like, "A personal brand is...". |
| Present Model           | 15 mins| Show a digital presentation where a fictional character presents their personal brand. Include key vocabulary and language structures in the presentation. Students will have a task to identify three strengths and two values of the character. Use visual aids and a graphic organizer to help students. During presentation checks, comprehension by asking, "What strengths does the character have?" and "Why are those strengths important?" Encourage peer discussion in pairs. |
| Useful Language         | 15 mins| Play a vocabulary matching game on a digital platform where students match words with definitions (e.g., strengths, values). Students work in small groups to complete this task. Afterward, hold a class discussion to confirm correct matches and correct any misconceptions. Provide sentence starters like "I am strong in..." and "One of my values is...". Reinforce vocabulary by modeling pronunciation and stress through choral repetition and individual practice. |
| Preparation             | 15 mins| Organize students into small groups and provide handouts with a worksheet that has sections for strengths, values, and experiences. Explain that students will create their personal branding statement. Encourage students to brainstorm within their groups and help them structure their ideas using provided prompts. Teacher circulates, providing feedback and scaffolding as necessary, guiding them to elaborate and use the target language accurately. |
| Complete Task           | 35 mins| Students practice delivering their personal brand statements in pairs. Each student presents their statement, and their partner listens and provides constructive feedback using prompts like, "I think you should also mention...". Rotate partners to provide students with various opportunities to practice. Monitor and take notes on language use for later feedback. Encourage students to self-assess their performance after each round. Emphasize fluency and clarity. |
| Feedback/Error Correction| 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session where key strengths and areas for improvement are highlighted. Use anonymous examples of common errors to address as a class. Encourage peer feedback by asking students questions like, "What did your partner do well?" and "How can they improve?" Provide corrective feedback with an emphasis on the positive aspects of their performance. Review pronunciation and stress patterns one more time through repetition to reinforce learning. |
| Flex-time/Buffer        | 5 mins | Address any remaining questions and concerns. Allow students to express doubts or need further clarification on topics covered. Use this time for additional practice or wrap-up activities if everything is covered. Ensure students leave the class feeling confident about the skills they have developed.|

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiate by providing additional support and sentence starters for less confident students.
- Be prepared to offer more complex vocabulary for advanced students needing additional challenges.
- Maintain classroom energy and engagement levels through interactive activities.
- Remember to maximize student talk time; ensure activities are student-centered. Avoid over-explaining.
