### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                     | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                  |
|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Warmer                    | 10 mins| Begin with a "Travel Bingo" game to engage students. Create bingo cards with various travel experiences (e.g., visited a beach, eaten foreign cuisine). Students mingle, asking each other if they've had these experiences. The first to get five in a row shouts "Bingo." This activity encourages interaction and warms up the class, fostering a lively atmosphere from the beginning.                                                                                                                                        | Encourage students to interact with different classmates. Clarify bingo rules.|
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins| Use a PowerPoint presentation with images of famous landmarks and countries. Ask students to share what they know about each picture. Create a mind map on the board with student contributions about what they can see and do in these places. This activity activates prior knowledge and sets the context for the lesson, engaging students with visual aids and collective participation.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Use open-ended questions to elicit varied responses. Keep the pace energetic.  |
| Present Model             | 15 mins| Play an audio clip of a native speaker describing a recent trip to a foreign country. Provide students with a task to note down key vocabulary and phrases related to landmarks, experiences, and opinions. Facilitate a brief discussion afterward, asking students to identify what made the speaker's descriptions engaging and informative. Allow them to compare their notes with a partner to reinforce understanding. This activity provides exposure to authentic language use in context, promoting active listening and language awareness. | Pause the audio occasionally to highlight key phrases. Use provided questions to scaffold student discussion. |
| Useful Language           | 15 mins| Conduct a "Comparatives and Superlatives Race" game. Students are divided into teams, each with a set of flashcards showing different adjectives. Teams race to form sentences using comparatives and superlatives regarding travel experiences (e.g., Tokyo is more vibrant than...). Use example sentences to demonstrate, and offer corrective feedback as needed. This game reinforces grammatical structures creatively, enhancing engagement and challenging students' language manipulation skills.                                                                                                                        | Model a few examples before starting the game. Ensure students understand sentence structures. |
| Preparation               | 15 mins| In pairs, students receive a handout with useful sentence starters (e.g., "One reason I want to visit... is...", "Comparing X and Y, I think..."). They choose a country they want to visit and prepare a short presentation, including what they want to see, do, and why. Walk around to offer guidance. This preparation phase helps students organize their thoughts, giving them confidence to express themselves accurately and fluently in the upcoming task.                                                                                                                                                                | Encourage students to use vocabulary from the lesson. Provide one-on-one support as needed. |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins| Engage students in a "Travel Debate." Each pair presents their travel destination to the class. After each presentation, classmates pose questions or challenges. Presenters defend their choice using researched information and prepared language. This activity stimulates fluency, critical thinking, and spontaneity, underpinned by prepared language and peer interaction. Celebrate diverse perspectives, promoting a rich environment for language production.                                                                                                          | Maintain a supportive atmosphere for all contributions. Stimulate questions by modeling open-ended inquiries. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins| Conclude with feedback focusing on both content and language use. Note common errors and highlight positive contributions anonymously for the class. Provide language-specific feedback, revisiting key vocabulary and correct usage of comparatives and superlatives. Encourage peer feedback, inviting the class to discuss what they found impressive. This consolidates learning, addresses errors constructively, and reinforces communicative competence.                                                                                                                                                       | Balance feedback between error correction and positive reinforcement. Use visual aids for clarifying common mistakes. |
| Flex-time/Buffer          | 5 mins | Address any emergent questions or clarify parts of the lesson. Use this time to recap key takeaways or extend speaking practice on a topic of particular interest to students. This buffer ensures flexibility to meet learners' needs and solidify comprehension before the class ends.                                                                                                                                                                          | Be prepared to adapt based on student requests or observations.  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation Strategies: Scaffold tasks for students who may need additional support with vocabulary or grammar. Offer more challenging questions for advanced students to ensure engagement.
- Classroom Management: Use signals for smooth transitions between activities. Maintain a dynamic classroom environment to keep energy levels high and facilitate language use.
- Common Pitfalls: Monitor for overuse of L1 (first language) during discussion times. Encourage peer corrections rather than direct teacher interventions to foster a more autonomous learning environment.
