| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Start with a simple game called "Word Association" related to conflicts and resolutions. Write the word "conflict" on the board. Students in a circle quickly say words they associate with "conflict," such as argue, fight, or solution. Encourage each student to contribute. Once the initial round is complete, write any new vocabulary words on the board, and explain their meanings using pictures or simple definitions. This activity activates prior knowledge, introduces key vocabulary, and sets the classroom's energetic tone.                                                                                                                                         | Involve students by encouraging them to show actions for some words, enhancing comprehension. Use visual aids or images to demonstrate complex words. Provide positive reinforcement to create a supportive environment.                                                                                                                       |

| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Present a short video clip showing a common conflict scenario among teenagers (e.g., two friends disagreeing over a game). After watching, students pair up to discuss what happened and how they might resolve the conflict. Conduct a class discussion where pairs share their ideas. This activity encourages engagement and connects students to the lesson topic by relating it to real-life experiences. It also helps activate existing schemata regarding conflict resolution techniques. Use questioning to draw out the students’ observations and guide them to the target language without over-instructing, allowing their ideas to shape the learning context.                 | Use open-ended questions to promote critical thinking. Be mindful of providing wait time and encouraging silent contemplation. Guide students to discover conflict resolution principles organically through their ideas while subtly directing them toward desired learning outcomes.                                  |

| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Introduce and display role-play cards featuring a scripted dialogue of a conflict scenario and its resolution. Highlight phrases used to resolve the conflict (e.g., "I understand your point, but...", "Let's find a way forward..."). Read through the script with the students, assigning roles and having them echo the teacher. Discuss the vocabulary and functions identified. Engage students in a short quiz to identify the correct expressions and functions within the dialogues. This scaffolding builds comprehension through modeling, peer echoing, and contextual analysis. The quiz provides formative assessment of understanding.                                                                                       | Reinforce learning by conducting a quick question-and-answer session. Encourage students to ask questions about the dialogue. Use visual aids to highlight vocabulary or key phrases. Ensure students understand the context before moving forward by assessing through formative checks.             |

| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Engage students in a role-play game, "Conflict Resolution Maze," where they collaborate in small groups to navigate various conflict scenarios on maze cards. Cards show different paths based on choices and language expressions used to resolve disputes (e.g., apologizing, compromising). The goal is to guide students in using language strategically to reach agreement. Offer sentence starters and visual aids to scaffold language use. This game not only reinforces vocabulary comprehension but also promotes confidence in spontaneous language production within structured support. It solidifies expression techniques and language application in dynamic contexts.                                                             | Encourage use of sentence starters to improve fluency. Monitor groups to offer guidance or language prompts when needed. Observe students’ application of expressions to correct minor errors immediately while also fostering peer support for language interaction.                                                            |

| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Allow groups to plan their unique conflict scenario, outlining characters, conflict, and resolution. Encouragement planning strategies include note-taking or graphic organizers to structure their interactions while preparing. Have students ponder potential disagreements and consolidate language functions utilizing role-play practice. Allow them to swap ideas and add creativity to their scenes. Gradually encourage independence by allowing them to navigate potential dialogues without teacher-led intervention. This stage facilitates self-directed learning and enhances strategic language formulation through collaborative engagement, leading towards authentic task fulfillment.                                             | Encourage open dialogue as groups organize ideas. Use graphic organizers to guide students’ organization, ensuring the identification of different resolution strategies. Provide support casually while fostering independence by gradually reducing guidance, highlighting autonomy and teamwork.                                 |

| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Implement a "Conflict Resolution Role-Play Festival." Groups perform their planned scenarios to the class. Students apply skills and language learned in the lesson by acting out conflicts and reaching resolution. Implement a peer evaluation form for students to assess performances based on creativity, language use, and effectiveness in conflict resolution. This encourages active participation, checks understanding, and stimulates reflective learning. Teachers circulate to observe, provide immediate feedback, or suggest language adjustments. Conclude with class feedback and assessment of overall communication effectiveness. This collaborative and interactive form of task engagement enhances fluency and language application.              | Observe quietly and note significant language issues to address later in the feedback section. Encourage positive peer feedback and promote constructive criticism. Use this practical setting to boost student interaction, focusing on mutual understanding rather than perfect language use.                                   |

| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Offer constructive feedback, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. Use examples from student performances to illustrate successful language use and common errors. Implement visual aids or sentence correction drills where students correct typical errors noticed during the role-playing activity. Encourage students to self-correct with peers in groups or pairs. This collaborative assessment not only reinforces correct language use but emphasizes analysis of peers' performances, nurturing critical thinking in language practice. Reinforce positive performance aspects by acknowledging efficient communication skills applied by students, fostering their confidence and motivation.                                                       | Focus on encouraging students through positive acknowledgment. Utilize friendly error correction, ensuring students do not feel disheartened by mistakes. Foster an environment where students are comfortable sharing feedback through prompts and questions. Assess understanding through interactive survey methods.                  |

| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Allow for flexibility by addressing emergent language questions, clarifying confusing aspects, or wrapping up any unfinished task components. Can be used for additional questions or a quick re-cap of vocabulary using a word scramble or digital quiz activity. Utilize digital tools to enhance comprehension through review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Be ready with digital resources or quick review games for additional engagement. Be flexible and attentive to class needs, ensuring any existing doubts are promptly addressed to prepare students for subsequent lessons.                                                                                          |
