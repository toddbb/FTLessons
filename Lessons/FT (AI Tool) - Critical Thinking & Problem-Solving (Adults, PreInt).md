| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description and Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins| Begin with a quick game called "Two Truths and a Lie." Students write down two true statements and one false statement about a topic related to their interests. They take turns sharing, and the class guesses the lie. This not only breaks the ice but encourages critical thinking from the start. This activity requires active listening and quick judgment, laying the groundwork for critical analysis skills. The teacher facilitates but encourages student interaction to ensure a low teacher-to-student talk ratio. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins| Set context by showing a short video clip of a popular reality TV problem-solving show. Ask students to discuss in pairs what strategies the participants used. Ask questions like: "What were the main issues?" "How did they solve them?" Use visual organizers on the board to map out ideas discussed. Scaffold by providing sentence starters and prompts, e.g., "They decided to…, because…" This helps activate prior knowledge and stimulates the topic in an engaging way, helping to transition smoothly into more focused activities. |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins| Play an audio clip involving a discussion between two people solving a problem. Provide students with a listening task to identify the key strategies discussed (e.g., "What solutions were suggested?"). After listening, have students compare answers in pairs. Highlight key language structures on the board, demonstrating expressions such as "If I were you, I would…" Model these phrases, first through repetition, and then in context. This stage fosters inductive learning, where students learn through engaging with the material before explicit teaching. |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins| Use a role-playing game to introduce the useful language in context. Students are divided into groups and given a problem scenario (e.g., lost luggage at an airport). Provide them with a language handout featuring expressions for giving opinions, agreeing, and disagreeing. Allow time for groups to discuss and role-play the scenario, ensuring sentences like "I think we should…" and "Let's consider…" are used. Monitor and support with prompts and feedback, scaffold using graphic organizers for them to structure their dialogue and provide peer support.|
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins| In groups, students choose a real-life problem (from a list you provide) to solve. They must brainstorm possible solutions, using the language and structures learned. Provide a graphic organizer to help them outline their strategy. Encourage them to use specific vocabulary and logical connectors. Walk around to monitor, offering support and guidance as needed. Use formative checks by asking groups probing questions, ensuring that all students actively participate and engage with the task's preparatory stage. |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins| Groups present their solutions to the class in a mini-debate format. Each group takes turns presenting their problem and solution, while others listen and take notes. Encourage students to ask questions or challenge ideas, using the language practiced earlier. This promotes peer interaction—students listen, evaluate, and respond critically to others' arguments. Ensure active involvement by rotating the roles of speakers and note-takers within groups, minimizing teacher intervention and maximizing student dialogue. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| Conclude with collective error correction. Highlight common errors from the presentations using examples on the board. Encourage self-correction and peer feedback. Reinforce accurate language use by reviewing key vocabulary and structures from the lesson. Praise successful strategies and expressions demonstrated by students, boosting confidence in their ability to think critically in English. Use this stage to also clarify any misunderstandings or gaps noticed during tasks. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins | Use this time to address any remaining questions or provide additional practice to students who need it. Offer personalized support if students express difficulty with any topic or task. Alternatively, use this time to extend the conversation into an area of particular interest to the group, encouraging further speaking practice. |

**Teacher Notes and Tips:**  
- Differentiate by offering additional vocabulary or scaffolding tools for students needing extra support.  
- Anticipate common pitfalls, such as over-reliance on native language – provide reminders and encouragement to focus on English communication.  
- Classroom management: Facilitate transitions between activities smoothly, maintaining engagement and focus.  
- Encourage students to draw connections with personal experiences to enhance relatability and retention.
