| Stage                            | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                           | 10 mins| Start with a game of "Two Truths and a Lie." Each student shares two true statements and one false about their daily life. The class guesses which statement is the lie. This activity helps foster a relaxed atmosphere and encourages students to start thinking about everyday activities. Pre-teach vocabulary related to everyday activities by using flashcards. Model a few examples and provide sentence starters for students who need additional support.                                                                                                                                                    | Ensure all students participate by guiding quieter students to share. Use visual aids for students who may struggle with vocabulary, and encourage peer support by having students work in small groups.                                                        |
| Lead-In / Set Context            | 10 mins| Introduce the topic by playing an audio clip of a natural English conversation about daily life. Ask students to note down phrases that indicate polite requests or small talk. Conduct a brief class discussion to set the context and gauge students' prior knowledge on the subject. Use this moment to address any unfamiliar vocabulary from the audio. Graphic organizers can be provided to help students categorize phrases they hear.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use comprehension checks to ensure students understand the audio content. Encourage predictions and personal connections to the topic. Adapt audio clips if needed to match student proficiency.                                                       |
| Present Model                    | 15 mins| Display a dialogue on the board featuring an everyday interaction (e.g., asking for directions, ordering at a caf√©). Highlight key phrases and question forms. Divide students into pairs and give them roles to practice the conversation. Demonstrate the role play first, focusing on intonation and expression. Support students with sentence frames and intonation guides. Gradually release responsibility by having students swap roles and create variations of the dialogue using their own ideas. This promotes both accuracy and creativity in conversation.                                                                                                                                               | Use gestures and exaggerated intonation during the model to emphasize pronunciation. Provide clear instructions for the role play, and circulate to offer help and corrections as needed.                                                               |
| Useful Language                  | 15 mins| Conduct a quiz game using digital tools like Kahoot to reinforce vocabulary and expressions. The game should focus on matching phrases with their meanings and selecting appropriate responses in various scenarios. Provide real-world examples to contextualize phrases. Use this stage to solidify the understanding of polite expressions and casual language use. Students will play individually on their devices, with formative assessments integrated through immediate feedback. This competition adds an engaging element and ensures active participation, reinforcing vocabulary retention through repetition and variety.                          | Encourage friendly competition, ensuring the focus remains on learning rather than winning. Occasionally pause the game to discuss why certain answers are correct or incorrect, providing clarifications as necessary.                               |
| Preparation                      | 15 mins| Students plan their role-play interactions using a set scenario (e.g., meeting a friend at a park, ordering food, or asking for help in a store). Provide them with a checklist to ensure they include specific language features: questions, polite requests, and appropriate closing phrases. Students draft their dialogues in pairs, using sentence starters and mind maps as organizational tools. This stage encourages collaboration and strategic planning, allowing students to balance accuracy with the flexibility needed for spontaneous dialogue.                                                                                               | Walk around to provide guidance and feedback as students develop their dialogues. Suggest the use of gestures and non-verbal cues to enhance authenticity in conversations. Use concept-checking questions to verify understanding of vocabulary and task.                         |
| Complete Task                    | 35 mins| Students perform their prepared dialogues in pairs, focusing on fluency and natural language use. The audience, comprising their classmates, takes notes on one positive aspect and one area for improvement for each pair's performance. Before the performances, revisit strategies for effective conversation, such as maintaining eye contact and using intonation. Encourage students to think on their feet, incorporating their peers' suggestions. This allows for an authentic experience and helps build confidence, as they practice speaking and critical listening in a supportive environment.                                    | Ensure smooth transitions between pairs. Monitor student participation to maintain a low teacher-talk ratio. Facilitate peer feedback by providing sentence frames for constructive comments (e.g., "I liked when you... You could improve by...").                              |
| Feedback/Error Correction        | 15 mins| Conduct a whole-class feedback session, highlighting common strengths and areas for improvement observed during the performances. Use examples from student interactions to illustrate pronunciation points or common mistakes. This feedback should be sensitive and constructive, guiding students towards self-improvement without discouragement. Reinforce correct usage through positive reinforcement and modeling of revised expressions where necessary. Incorporate mini-drills if a particular error pattern is prevalent, ensuring these exercises are interactive and engaging.                                                                                                                                             | Keep feedback balanced by focusing on positive aspects as well as areas needing correction. Allow for student input in the feedback process, encouraging self-reflection. Be attentive to varying proficiency levels to ensure feedback is accessible. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiation strategies include varying the complexity of dialogue models to suit different proficiency levels.
- Be mindful of classroom management by establishing clear signals for transitioning between activities.
- Encourage quieter students by pairing them with more confident peers and offering additional scaffolding where needed.
- Use visual cues and interactive elements to maintain engagement and interest throughout the lesson.
- Address common pitfalls like the overuse of fillers ("um," "uh") by modeling concise communication.
