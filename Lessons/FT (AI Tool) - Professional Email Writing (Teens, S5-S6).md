### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage | Timing | Extensive Activity Description |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Warmer | 10 mins | Begin the lesson with a quick icebreaker game called "Email Chain". Each student writes a sentence starting an email on a sheet of paper then passes it to the next student, who continues the email. This goes around the class until the email is completed. This energizes students, encourages creativity, and introduces them gently to the concept of email writing. The teacher provides a sentence starter to scaffold the task. |
| Lead-In / Set Context | 10 mins | Ask students about the types of emails they've encountered in their daily lives. Transition by showing a humorous video clip of a poorly written email and discuss as a class why it was ineffective. Use guiding questions to elicit students' understanding of professional vs. casual emails. Scaffold with visual aids showing different email types. |
| Present Model | 15 mins | Display a sample professional email on the projector. Break down each part of the email, highlighting the greeting, introduction, body, and closing. Provide a task where students identify these parts in example emails. Use think-pair-share to encourage collaboration and peer discussion. Conclude with a formative assessment by asking students to verbally summarize the elements of a professional email. |
| Useful Language | 15 mins | Engage students in a language-focused game called "Phrase Match". On handouts, provide a list of key phrases used in professional emails. Students must match them with their definitions. Next, they use these phrases in context by rephrasing casual sentences into professional ones. Teacher models a few transformations before students try independently. Check understanding by having students read some transformations out loud. |
| Preparation | 15 mins | Students choose a scenario from a list (e.g., requesting information, apologizing for a mistake) to write about. They begin planning their email using a graphic organizer that outlines the email's structure. Peers review the plans, providing feedback and suggestions. Teacher circulates, offering guidance and addressing misconceptions. Scaffold with sentence starters and transitional phrase banks. |
| Complete Task | 35 mins | In pairs, students write a full professional email based on their chosen scenario. Encourage them to focus on both accuracy and fluency. Use a timer for each section of the email to ensure balance. As students write, the teacher provides support through focused conferences with pairs, ensuring the teacher-talk ratio stays low. Students then practice reading their emails to peers for clarity and feedback on phrasing and pronunciation. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Conduct a whole-class feedback session. Invite a few pairs to read their emails aloud. Use this as a learning opportunity to discuss common errors and effective strategies seen in their work. Offer positive reinforcement and tip students on areas needing improvement. Encourage peer corrections and suggestions. Conclude with reflective questions on what they learned about professional email writing. |
| Flex-time/Buffer | 5 mins | Allow time for unanswered questions, additional explanations, or an impromptu fun activity like "Email Jeopardy" using vocabulary and phrases from the lesson if time permits. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Scaffold activity by initially modeling email writing, providing exemplars.
- Ensure equitable participation by gently prompting quieter students.
- Address multitasking issues; set clear individual and paired timeframes.
- Encourage students to use dictionaries or online tools for unfamiliar words.
- Be culturally sensitive to different styles of professional communication.
