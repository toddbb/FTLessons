### Lesson Procedures

| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins | Begin by playing a short video montage featuring snippets from K-pop performances, anime scenes, and streaming highlights. This will serve to grab the students' attention and pique their interest in the topic. Encourage students to share any content they recognized. Use this opportunity to establish connections between the students’ experiences and the lesson topic. Instruct students to pair up and discuss their favorite pop culture icons or shows they enjoy. This initial interaction will set a relaxed tone, helping to build rapport among classmates. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Activate students' prior knowledge by asking them to brainstorm global pop culture elements they are familiar with. Use the whiteboard to jot down ideas, categorizing them under themes like music, movies, and streaming. Once the brainstorming session is over, briefly discuss each theme to set the context of the lesson. Highlight how diverse and widespread pop culture has become, making it an exciting topic for discussion. Keep teacher talk to a minimum, using open-ended questions to facilitate student contributions. |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins | Present students with short video clips from different cultural phenomena, such as a popular K-pop band, a trending anime series, and a popular streaming show. Set a task for students to identify the main genre and the emotional tone of each clip. After watching each clip, have small group discussions where students share their thoughts on what they watched. This provides a context for the language while giving a model for how to express opinions and describe content. Actively circulate to assist and ensure students are using English. |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins | Introduce vocabulary and phrases using a matching game to reinforce understanding. Prepare cards with pop culture-related words on one set and definitions/synonyms on another. Students work in pairs to match the two sets. Provide sentence starters and expressions like "I prefer...", "I think... is better because...", "In my opinion...", to help students form their opinions and recommendations. Implement frequent checks for understanding by asking students to use new vocabulary in sentences with their partners. Use visuals and synonyms to clarify any challenging words. |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins | Allow students time to prepare for a speaking task where they will recommend and describe a piece of media to their peers. Provide graphic organizers for structuring their recommendations, such as noting down three reasons why they like a particular show or artist. Encourage the use of sentence starters and model talk for support. Model and demonstrate a brief example in front of the class before they begin their preparation. This preparation stage enables structured practice and helps build students' confidence for the main speaking task. |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins | Conduct a "Talk Show" simulation where students take turns acting as hosts and guests discussing their favorite shows, artists, or genres. Encourage spontaneity and natural flow in the conversation by minimizing teacher intervention, only stepping in for guidance or to extend the task as needed. Organize students in groups and have them rotate roles to ensure everyone practices both hosting and guest roles. To support lower ability students, provide prompts or sentence strips. Monitor and provide real-time feedback wherever needed. Use formative assessment by taking notes on performance to be addressed in the feedback stage. |
| **Feedback / Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide group feedback and individual observation on students' participation, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Use specific examples from the Talk Show task to offer constructive critiques on fluency, accuracy, and the use of new vocabulary. Encourage peer feedback by having students share one thing they admired about a classmate’s performance. End the session with a recap of the vocabulary and functional language covered, reinforcing correct usage through brief error correction exercises. Address any remaining questions from the lesson. |
| **Flex-time / Buffer**    | 5 mins  | Open the floor to any additional questions about the lesson content or allow students extra time to discuss any emergent topics of interest within their groups. If time allows, let students suggest additional media they think the class might enjoy, fostering an inclusive and interest-driven learning environment. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing more support to facilitate peer learning. Provide visual cues and sentence strips for students who may find verbal expression challenging.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may initially hesitate to speak due to unfamiliarity; encourage participation by modeling positive language and maintaining a non-judgmental atmosphere.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain active engagement using movement-based activities like matching games. Structure activities to ensure a balance between controlled practice and freer practice.
