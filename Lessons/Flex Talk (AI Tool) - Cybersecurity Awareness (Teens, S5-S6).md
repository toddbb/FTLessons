## Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Begin with a quick game called "Tech Speak". Students form a circle. The teacher starts by saying a technology-related word, and students have to continue around the circle, each saying a new word within 2 seconds, related to technology. If a student hesitates or repeats, they're out. This engages students and introduces the lesson theme. During the game, observe students’ familiarity with tech vocabulary, noting any unfamiliar terms.| Use this game as an opportunity to introduce the lesson theme subtly. Encourage students to include both familiar and new terms as a segue to the lesson’s content. Offer praise for quick responses to build energy and engagement from the start.                  |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Present a short, engaging video clip that highlights a real-life example of a cybersecurity breach. After watching, ask students questions to elicit their initial thoughts about cybersecurity. Encourage them to speak in pairs about what they think was happening and why cybersecurity is essential. This activity activates background knowledge and stimulates interest in the topic. Take notes of students' answers for language feedback later.| Ensure the video is age-appropriate and not too technical. Keep a balance between visual and cognitive stimulation. Provide pairwork to encourage all students to voice their opinions and build comprehension through peer discussion.                           |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Distribute a handout with a conversation model. The script is a dialogue between two friends discussing the importance of cybersecurity after one receives a suspicious email. As students read, circulate and provide support. After reading, have selected pairs perform the dialogue. Use this performance to highlight key language points, such as expressions for advice and expressing concern. Students must identify sentences offering advice or describing risks.| Emphasize expressions used for giving advice and discussing concerns. Model the dialogue with a strong focus on pronunciation and intonation before students practice. Encourage creativity when students perform, allowing for adaptation and personalization.|
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Play a vocabulary matching game using the whiteboard. Students match cybersecurity terms with definitions. Terms include: phishing, malware, firewall, password manager, encryption. Divide the class into teams and use a competitive format where teams race to the board to find pairs. This activity reinforces vocabulary recognition and comprehension in a lively, energetic manner. Rotate roles to ensure all get a chance to participate.| Consider providing hints or visual clues for more challenging terms. Support students asynchronously by having peers offer hints or explanations to one another. Regularly check for understanding through random quick assessments or gestures of agreement/disagreement.|
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| In small groups, students brainstorm potential online threats faced by someone their age and strategies to protect themselves. Provide a graphic organizer to help structure ideas, listing threats and safety tips. Circulate, offering guidance, and ask predictive questions to foster deeper thinking. This planning supports structured spoken interaction later. Prepare students for the subsequent role-play activity by rehearsing key phrases.| Encourage detailed discussions with focus questions: "What could happen if we don't protect our data?" or "How can we tell if a link is secure?" Provide sentence starters and sample answers to assist students who need additional support.                                       |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Students engage in a role-play scenario where they act as cybersecurity consultants for a fictional client who experiences various online issues. Each group presents a different scenario (e.g., encountering phishing, malware threats). They advise the client using information discussed. Rotate roles to ensure everyone practices speaking. After presentations, classmates offer feedback using sentence frames to provide structure.| Monitor group interactions for balanced participation, offering quieter students prompts or sentence frames. Capture common language errors or successful strategies, and address these in the feedback session. Encourage creativity in role-playing expressions and problem-solving.    |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Provide specific feedback on language use—focus on vocabulary accuracy, fluency, intonation, and error correction. Use the board to record common phrases or errors noted during activities. Address errors in a supportive manner by inviting students to self-correct. Conclude with a reflective group discussion about their learnings and experiences during the lesson. This allows teachers to gauge understanding and areas for further practice.| Use positive reinforcement and validate creative approaches during tasks. Implement a "two stars and a wish" feedback strategy—highlighting two positive uses of language and one area for improvement. Encourage students to share their reflections for peer insights.                    |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Pair stronger speakers with those needing more support. Offer extra guidance to lower B1 students through sentence starters or visual aids.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may confuse technical terms; reinforce vocabulary with visual cues and repetition. Be ready to clarify misunderstood concepts swiftly.
- **Classroom Management:** Use clear signals for transitions between activities and monitor time closely to maintain lesson pacing.


# Handouts

## Cybersecurity Awareness Dialogue

**Situation**: Emma has received a suspicious email and discusses it with her friend, Jake.

**Emma:** I got an email from someone I don't know saying I've won a prize.
**Jake:** That sounds like phishing! Did they ask for any personal information?
**Emma:** Yes, they did. I wasn't sure if I should reply.
**Jake:** It's not safe! You should never share personal details with unknown senders.
**Emma:** What should I do?
**Jake:** Mark it as spam and delete it right away. You should also update your passwords and use a password manager.
