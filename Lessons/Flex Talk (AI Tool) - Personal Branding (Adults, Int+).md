| Warmer                      | 10 mins | Begin with a group mingle activity. Students walk around sharing one personal achievement with a peer. Each pair exchanges achievements and briefly discusses. This encourages ease and rapport among students. After five minutes, ask a few students to share what they learned about their peers with the class. This activity sets a positive tone, enhances listening and speaking skills, and emphasizes the lesson's focus on self-presentation.                                             | Encourage students to use English exclusively. Model an achievement description to guide students. Monitor interactions and intervene only if necessary, promoting peer support and autonomy.                                                                                                                                            |
| Lead-In / Set Context       | 10 mins | Show a short video clip on personal branding with subtitles. Pause intermittently to ask students to predict what will happen next or to explain certain terms used in the video. Discuss how personal branding can impact their professional lives. This task activates prior knowledge, introduces context, and prompts students to begin thinking critically about personal branding and its importance.                                                                                                                                        | Use open-ended questions to stimulate discussions. Allow students to first discuss in pairs and then share their ideas with the class.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Present Model               | 15 mins | Provide students with example personal branding statements from well-known professionals. Ask them to read and discuss in small groups: What makes these statements effective? Groups then summarize a key element of effective branding and share with the class. This models clear, professional expression of strengths and values, encouraging students to identify effective language strategies for self-presentation.                                                                                                  | Use prompt cards with guiding questions to facilitate discussions. Walk around to offer support and address questions. Encourage use of specific language and examples.                                                                                                                          |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins | Conduct an interactive game called "Brand Bingo." Create bingo cards with vocabulary related to personal branding. As you read a definition or description aloud, students must identify and mark the correct term on their cards. The first student to complete their bingo card wins. Reinforce vocabulary understanding through fun, repetition, and engagement, thus preparing students to describe their own personal brands effectively.                                                                                                           | Pre-teach vocabulary through visuals before the game begins. Allow students to work in pairs, enhancing peer learning. Provide instant feedback on correct matches.                                                                                                                            |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins | Ask students to draft their personal branding statements using a structured template. Include prompts for strengths, values, and experiences. Encourage students to peer review their drafts and offer constructive feedback. This phase allows students to organize their thoughts, aligning personal experiences with the lesson's theme, and helps build confidence before presenting.                                                                                                                                            | Provide a sample template. Ensure students are using target vocabulary and sentence structures. Move around the room to assist students individually.                                                                                                                                          |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins | Facilitate a role-playing activity where students present their personal branding statements in a mock networking event. Each student delivers their statement to a small group, receives feedback, and rotates to another group. Encourage the audience to ask follow-up questions and engage in discussions. This task promotes fluency and application of language skills in a realistic setting, boosting learners’ confidence in articulating their personal brand.                                                            | Brief students on how to give constructive feedback. Remind them of the importance of active listening. Limit teacher intervention to allow natural conversation flow.                                                                                                                         |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins | Conduct a whole-class feedback session. Highlight common strengths and areas for improvement observed during the role-play. Use examples from student presentations to correct pronounciation or grammar errors and to praise effective language use. Encourage self-reflection by asking students to note one thing they did well and one area for improvement. This consolidates learning and motivates students to refine their personal branding skills further.                                                                                         | Be sensitive with corrections, focusing on common issues and not individual students. Offer praise to balance critiques, maintaining a positive learning environment. Encourage peer feedback as part of formative assessment.                                                                   |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins  | Allow time for students to ask questions or share additional reflections. As a class, brainstorm one personal branding tip each student commits to applying. This collective activity fosters a sense of responsibility towards self-improvement and reinforces key lesson learnings.                                                                                                                                         | Use this time to clarify misunderstandings. Summarize key points learned in the lesson to reinforce retention.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
