### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                      | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                     | 10 mins    | Begin with an interactive game of “Email Charades.” Students mime parts of an email (e.g., typing a subject, writing a greeting) while others guess. This energizes students and helps them recall any prior knowledge of email terminology.                                                                                                 | Encourage students to use gestures, enhancing their understanding of non-verbal communication. Maintain a fun atmosphere to reduce stress.     |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**      | 10 mins    | Show an exemplar professional email on the screen. Ask students what they notice about the format and language. Conduct a brief discussion about the purpose of professional emails. Follow with students sharing prior experiences or what they think professional emails are usually about.                              | Focus on student-centered interaction. Use questions to guide the discussion and prompt students to notice specific parts of the email format.  |
| **Present Model**              | 15 mins    | Introduce a sample email with sections labeled (greeting, body, closing). Give students a task to fill in missing parts of the email (e.g., subject, sender’s name) using sentence starters. This should be a collaborative task where students work in pairs, promoting peer-to-peer scaffolding and active engagement.            | Provide an accurate model to avoid misconceptions. Use a visual aid such as a graphic organizer to make connections between parts of the email. |
| **Useful Language**            | 15 mins    | Teach vocabulary through a “Vocabulary Bingo” game. Prepare bingo cards with key email phrases. Call out definitions while students mark the correct word on their cards. This game-based approach reinforces understanding and retention of vocabulary pertinent to email writing.                                      | Ensure all students have equal participation opportunities by rotating callers. Use formative checks by asking students to explain choices.      |
| **Preparation**                | 15 mins    | Students plan their own professional email based on prompts (e.g., requesting information from a teacher). Provide graphic organizers to structure their planning. Facilitate peer discussions where students share ideas and give feedback to one another on their email drafts.                                 | Provide sentence starters and visual aids. Be available for guidance but encourage independence. Offer feedback to ensure understanding.        |
| **Complete Task**              | 35 mins    | Students individually write their professional emails using the planned outline. During writing, wander the room providing real-time feedback. Encourage students to refer to the vocabulary and email structure handouts to aid accuracy and fluency. Post-writing, facilitate peer reviews for collaborative learning.   | Apply the “gradual release of responsibility model”—monitor and assist but allow students to independently explore and learn through experience.   |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**  | 15 mins    | Conduct a group feedback session. Highlight common strengths and areas for improvement without singling out students. Use an anonymous error board where common errors are corrected in a collaborative manner. Discuss variations and effective alternatives to problematic sentences.                                    | Foster a safe space for error correction. Stress the importance of learning from mistakes. Engage students in suggesting corrections and improvements. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)**| 5 mins     | Any remaining time can be dedicated to questions, clarifying doubts about professional email writing, or practicing difficult structures from observed common errors.                                                                           | Use this time to address individual student queries with additional examples or practice as needed.                                          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use tiered prompts for varying levels of language ability. Provide extra support through visual aids and customizable sentence starters for struggling students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch out for students confusing casual and formal tones. Reinforce the importance of politeness in professional emails.
- **Classroom Management:** Establish clear rules for games to maintain engagement and structure. Use timers for activities to keep students focused and on task.
