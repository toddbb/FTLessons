### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins | Begin with a simple ice-breaker game called "Two Truths and a Lie" relevant to teamwork experiences. Each student shares two true statements and one false statement about past teamwork experiences. Encourage classmates to guess the lie. This activity not only builds rapport but also sets a cooperative tone. Use guiding questions like "Have you been part of a team before?" or "Was there a time you helped a teammate?" to elicit responses. This ensures active engagement and interaction.                                                                                   |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins | Engage students in a brainstorming session using a mind map on the board. The central theme is "Teamwork." Encourage students to suggest words and phrases they associate with teamwork. Use prompts and visuals to guide students in exploring ideas. As students contribute, model correct pronunciation and scaffold by providing sentence starters like, “One thing a team needs is…” or “In a team, we should always…” This session activates prior knowledge and sets the context for deeper exploration.                                      |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins | Show a short video clip of a team working together on a project. Before playing, hand out worksheets with key questions to guide their viewing, such as "What roles do you see?" and "How do they make decisions?" After the viewing, engage students in a discussion about the video. Use visual aids on slides to highlight and teach new vocabulary. Model the pronunciation of new terms, encouraging choral and individual repetition. Regular comprehension checks ensure students grasp key points.                                             |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins | Introduce a game-based activity called "Vocabulary Bingo" focusing on teamwork-related words. Give each student a bingo card filled with target vocabulary. As you describe each word, students mark their cards. For example, describe "leader" as "Someone who guides others in a group." First to complete their card shouts "Bingo!" Ensure instructions are clear and check understanding before starting. This fun activity integrates learning vocabulary and meaningfully using it in communication.                                    |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins | Divide students into small groups and assign each a team-based task, such as planning a class event or creating an art project. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their planning. Encourage the use of vocabulary and phrases learned earlier. circulating to offer support and answer questions, promote the use of sentence starters like, “Shall we…?”, “What if we..?” This planning stage focuses on structured communication, encouraging clear and organized interaction among students.                                          |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins | Have each group present their team project to the class. Assign roles within the group to ensure equal participation. During presentations, peers note down questions or feedback. Encourage active listening and supportive feedback from classmates. After presentations, facilitate a group discussion, eliciting reflections on teamwork, what worked well, and areas for improvement. Use prompts like, “How did your group decide on…” This activity enhances fluency and showcases the practical application of newly acquired language.              |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback on language use during presentations and group work. Highlight common errors and model correct usage. Facilitate a mini-quiz to reinforce vocabulary, with students working in pairs to answer questions. This peer collaboration aids in reinforcing learning. Encourage self-reflection by asking students to identify what they did well and what they could improve in teamwork and language use. Celebrate successes to boost confidence and motivation.                                      |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)**| 5 mins  | Use this time to address any emergent needs or questions from students, offer additional clarification on teamwork concepts, or play a quick additional vocabulary game. This ensures all students leave the session with clarified understanding and satisfaction with their learning experience.                                                                                              |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Adapt the complexity of language support and resources based on individual student needs. Provide additional sentence starters or visual supports for lower-level students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students might struggle with equal participation in group tasks; ensure roles are clearly defined.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure active participation by rotating roles within groups and providing clear guidelines and expectations for each task.
