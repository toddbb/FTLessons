| Stage                     | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                    | 10 mins| Begin with an icebreaker game, "Leadership Lineup," where students are given role cards (leader, team member, etc.). They must silently organize themselves into a lineup according to perceived leadership roles. This non-speaking start uses body language and is intended to help students consider different leadership roles right from the start. Discuss briefly what they noticed about leadership characteristics without words. | Use role cards that vary in leadership style, such as authoritarian leader, democratic leader, etc. Encourage students to observe and reflect on non-verbal cues.                                                                                          |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins| Introduce the topic with a short video clip showcasing effective leadership in a group task setting. After viewing, ask students to share their initial thoughts in pairs. These pairs will discuss what leadership qualities they noticed. This sets the groundwork by combining visual stimuli with collaborative discourse.                                                                                                                                                                  | Pose open-ended questions to stimulate discussion such as "What did you notice about how the leader communicated?" Utilize visual aids such as screenshots from the video to reinforce key points.                                                                                          |
| Present Model             | 15 mins| Students listen to a dialogue between two team members discussing a group project. Provide them with a task to identify expressions of leadership and responsibility. Play the dialogue twice; first for gist, second for details. Students jot down phrases or statements that illustrate leadership qualities. Compare findings in small groups, then share responses with the class. Use this to model effective leadership communication.                                          | Offer scaffolding through sentence starters and display them clearly for reference. Example: "I believe a good leader should...". Ensure vocabulary support is available through handouts.                                                                                                     |
| Useful Language           | 15 mins| Conduct a vocabulary-building game "Leadership Bingo." Provide students with bingo cards filled with vocabulary words. Read out definitions or sentences containing the words, and students must match these to their cards. This interactive activity deepens their understanding of leadership-related terms while engaging them in a competitive format. Conclude with a brief discussion of the words they've matched.                                                         | Provide a word bank before beginning to empower less confident students. Consider different levels of hints depending on proficiency, such as giving the first letter of the word. Encourage peer support during the game.                                                                  |
| Preparation               | 15 mins| Distribute a handout with a group task scenario. Students must prepare in small groups for a role-play where they’ll showcase leadership and responsibility in problem-solving a conflict. Each group brainstorms ideas, assigns roles (leader, mediator, etc.), and plans their dialogue. Encourage structured preparation with clear objectives: effectively express leadership and handle the conflict with responsibility.                                                  | Circulate to facilitate group discussions and provide assistance as needed. Prompt students with guiding questions to ensure they're on track, such as "What should a leader do in this situation?" Reinforce the use of vocabulary and expressions.                                                  |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins| Execute the role-play activity. Groups act out their scenarios, demonstrating the language and strategies they have prepared. Each group presents to the class, followed by a Q&A session where peers ask questions about their leadership approach. Utilize peer and self-evaluation through a checklist focusing on effective communication skills and leadership qualities. Follow up with facilitator-led feedback encouraging reflection on their performance.                | Reduce TTT by allowing students to facilitate the post-presentation Q&A. Encourage active listening and constructive feedback. Rotate roles if time allows to provide multiple perspectives. Use exemplars and sentence starters for peer feedback.                                                |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins| Combine whole-class feedback with individual notes. Focus on recurring language issues and acknowledge successful use of the target language. Engage students in error correction through examples and encourage them to self-correct. Highlight positive communication examples demonstrating effective leadership and responsibility. Provide corrective language models and practice error correction collaboratively.                                                              | Use visual aids to highlight common errors. Encourage peer feedback by organizing errors anonymously. Emphasize the growth mindset in language learning; mistakes are stepping stones.                                                                                                           |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins | Provide additional time for addressing questions or extending activities as needed. This optional buffer ensures the flow of the lesson remains smooth and responsive to student needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use this time flexibly based on classroom dynamics. Address any emergent issues or reinforce key learning points.                                                                                                                                   |
