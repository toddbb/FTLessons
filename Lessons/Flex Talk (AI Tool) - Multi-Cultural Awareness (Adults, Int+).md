### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                     | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins| Begin with a quick group game, "Cultural Bingo," where students find classmates who match cultural statements on a bingo card (e.g., speaks two languages, has lived abroad). This encourages interaction, sets a fun tone, and builds cultural curiosity. The teacher circulates, facilitating and ensuring everyone participates. This step is crucial for building rapport and lowering affective filters, essential for language acquisition (Krashen's Input Hypothesis).                                                  |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins| Show a short video clip portraying a multicultural environment at work. Students discuss in pairs what they observed, focusing on cultural differences and interactions. This phase activates prior knowledge and gets students thinking about the topic in context. Sentence starters such as "I noticed that..." or "It seems that..." will be provided to aid initial discussions, ensuring all students can contribute meaningfully.                                       |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins| Introduce a reading passage about the benefits and challenges of multicultural workplaces. Students read and underline key vocabulary like "diversity" and "inclusivity." The teacher models pronunciation and meaning with examples. Students then work in pairs, using graphic organizers to categorize advantages and challenges from the text. This promotes peer learning and allows for formative assessment through questions on comprehension.                               |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins| Engage students in a digital game on Kahoot, where they answer questions about the vocabulary and phrases related to multiculturalism. Use questions like, "What does inclusivity mean?" or "Give an example of prejudice." The interactive platform supports engagement and allows students to check their understanding in real-time. This stage utilizes a game-based approach to consolidate language in a lively, enjoyable manner, with immediate feedback facilitating learning.                        |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins| In groups, students plan a short presentation sharing their perspectives on an aspect of multiculturalism. They use provided speaking frames and a checklist to structure their talks. The teacher circulates, offering support and feedback. This preparation phase is key for organizing thoughts and ensuring language accuracy, gradually releasing responsibility from teacher to student as they build confidence.                                                       |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins| Groups present their ideas to the class, practicing fluent and clear communication. Classmates use a simple feedback form, focusing on content and delivery. The teacher notes language use for later feedback. Peer assessments provide insights and encourage reflective learning. This task enables real-world communication practice, crucial for language acquisition.                                                                           |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conduct a plenary session where the teacher provides feedback on common errors noted during presentations, plus positive reinforcement for effective language use. Use a mix of direct correction and eliciting self-correction. Highlight any inspiring ideas or effective uses of new vocabulary, reinforcing learning. This final phase consolidates knowledge, clears up any misconceptions, and fosters confidence for future communication.                           |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**      | 5 mins | Address any emergent questions or revisit a point from the lesson with more depth as needed. This time can be used flexibly to clarify understanding, ensuring student confidence as they leave the class.                                               |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer additional prompts or sentence starters for less confident speakers. Encourage advanced learners to explore nuances in multicultural debates.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Be aware of the potential for some students to hold strong opinions on multicultural issues. Handle these sensitively to maintain a respectful classroom atmosphere.
- **Classroom Management:** Keep an eye on time during presentations to ensure everyone gets a chance to speak. Create a supportive environment that values empathy and understanding.
