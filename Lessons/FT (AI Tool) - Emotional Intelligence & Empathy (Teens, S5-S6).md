| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Instruction Tips                                                           |

| Warmer                     | 10 mins | Begin with a "Feelings Charades" game. Divide students into small groups. Each group sends a representative to act out different emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised) while the rest of the group guesses. This creates a lively atmosphere and gets students thinking about emotions. Pre-teach essential emotions vocabulary. This activity taps into multiple intelligences and sets the context for discussing emotional intelligence.                                      | Monitor group interactions, encourage all students to participate.         |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins | Introduce the topic by showing a short, engaging video clip on why emotional intelligence is important in everyday life. While watching, students have to note down two benefits mentioned in the video. After viewing, conduct a quick pair discussion to share notes. This stage activates prior knowledge and primes students for deeper engagement. Ensure students understand the importance of emotional intelligence by linking it to their own experiences.                                   | Use visual aids and prompts to reinforce understanding.                    |
| Present Model              | 15 mins | Present a dialogue between two people discussing emotional intelligence. The dialogue script is provided in the handouts. Read through the script aloud as students follow along, modeling pronunciation and intonation. Students then work in pairs to practice the dialogue. Focus on the use of modal verbs for expressing opinions. This reinforces grammatical structures while allowing students to work on their pronunciation and fluency.                                          | Emphasize intonation and stress in key words.                             |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins | Conduct a "Vocabulary Bingo" game with key terms related to emotional intelligence. Provide students with bingo cards filled with vocabulary words. As definitions are read aloud, students mark the corresponding word. The first to complete a line shouts "Bingo!" Use this activity to review vocabulary, strengthen comprehension, and encourage recall. The game-like format maintains high energy and student engagement. Vocabulary focuses on both meaning and correct pronunciation.                     | Provide immediate feedback and clarification on vocabulary usage.         |
| Preparation                | 15 mins | In small groups, students brainstorm scenarios in which emotional intelligence is crucial. Provide a graphic organizer to help structure their ideas. Each group selects a scenario (e.g., resolving a conflict with a friend) and prepares to role-play it. Guidance is given through sentence starters and prompts. Gradual release of responsibility allows students to prepare independently but with some scaffolding in the form of organizers and peer support.                                    | Rotate around groups, offering strategic input and encouragement.          |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins | Groups perform their role-plays, showcasing their understanding of emotional intelligence in different contexts. Encourage students to focus on both verbal and non-verbal cues in their performances. After each performance, peers provide feedback on empathy and communication skills observed, using a checklist provided in the handout. This encourages self-assessment and peer feedback. The role-play format encourages creativity, active engagement, and application of learning in a simulated real-world context. | Encourage constructive feedback during peer reviews.                      |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins | Provide targeted feedback on language use observed during role-plays, focusing on vocabulary accuracy, pronunciation, and grammatical correctness. Highlight positive examples and areas for improvement. Use specific instances from the performances to teach self-correction techniques. Feedback session reinforces learning by celebrating successes and thoughtfully addressing errors. This stage is integral for refining language skills and boosting confidence.                             | Avoid over-correction; focus on trends rather than isolated errors.        |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)| 5 mins  | Use this time to address any outstanding questions or conduct a quick recap game if students finished early. Conduct a fast round of questions based on today’s topic using a digital quiz tool, allowing students to reflect on what they learned. This offers flexibility to personalize learning and can provide closure or additional learning reinforcement if needed.                                                                                                                  | Be adaptive to the needs of the class and ready to adjust plans as necessary. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation strategies may include modifying the difficulty of vocabulary for varying levels and providing extra support materials for lower-level students.
- Be mindful of classroom dynamics—some students may need encouragement to engage in role-plays due to shyness.
- Utilize digital resources for quizzes and videos to maintain high engagement levels and cater to varied learning preferences.
- Remind students to respect and value each other's performances and feedback, fostering a supportive learning environment.
