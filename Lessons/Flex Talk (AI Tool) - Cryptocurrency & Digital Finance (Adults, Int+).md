| **Stage**                             | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description and Instructions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Teacher Notes and Tips**                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                            | 10 mins    | Initiate a brief group discussion on students' familiarity with digital finance by asking questions like, "Have you ever used cryptocurrency?" Using visual aids like images of Bitcoin logos, gauge student interest. Encourage sharing experiences or stories related to online transactions, allowing everyone to speak in simple terms.   | Use a projector or whiteboard to display images. Encourage students to listen and share, promoting a low-pressure environment.                                         |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**             | 10 mins    | Present a short, engaging video summarizing the basics of cryptocurrency. Give students a task to note down at least two interesting facts. After the video, conduct a quick pair-share to exchange information and answer comprehension questions, setting the scene for a deeper dive into specific digital currencies.                                           | Integrate pauses into the video for key points. Provide comprehension questions before starting to guide student viewing.                                               |
| **Present Model**                     | 15 mins    | Divide students into small groups, providing each group with a short article on digital currency basics. Ask them to identify definitions and uses of key terms (e.g., blockchain, transaction). Each group shares their findings with the class, using sentence starters provided on a handout to construct meaningful explanations.                                                | Circulate to offer support and ensure active participation. Use the gradual release model: modeling → guiding → independent.                                           |
| **Useful Language**                   | 15 mins    | Facilitate a vocabulary-based game, such as "Cryptocurrency Bingo," where students mark off terms related to cryptocurrency as definitions or examples are read aloud. Encourage interaction as students collaborate to complete their game cards. Use visual aids and real-world examples to contextualize vocabulary.                                                     | Adjust game difficulty based on student level. Highlight common pitfalls in pronunciation using IPA transcriptions provided in handouts.                               |
| **Preparation**                       | 15 mins    | In pairs, students prepare for a role-play scenario where one person is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and the other is skeptical about digital finance. Provide prompts and a graphic organizer to scaffold dialogue planning. Focus on language structures for expressing opinions and explaining benefits and concerns.                                                                                  | Provide sentence frames and language prompts on board. Observe pair interactions to ensure understanding and offer guidance as needed.                                |
| **Complete Task**                     | 35 mins    | Students perform their role-plays in small groups, discussing the benefits and challenges of using cryptocurrency for everyday transactions. Encourage them to incorporate vocabulary and structures from previous stages. Teachers observe, facilitating as needed, ensuring each student speaks. Feedback given based on target language use, fluency, and interaction.                | Use formative assessment at intervals to provide immediate feedback. Maintain a supportive atmosphere to foster confidence and fluency.                                |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**         | 15 mins    | Conduct a feedback session where common errors noticed during role-plays are addressed. Use examples from students to highlight effective language use and areas needing improvement. Encourage peer feedback using sentence starters ("I liked when you said...," "Next time, try..."). Wrap up with a group discussion on the potential future of digital finance.    | Focus on positive reinforcement and constructive feedback. Employ simple error correction techniques like recasting and elicitation. Include peer feedback as a regular practice. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)**       | 5 mins     | Address any emergent language needs or questions from students. Use this time for additional practice or clarification on challenging concepts, ensuring all students feel comfortable with the lesson's vocabulary and topics.                                                                                                                                                                  | Be adaptable to student needs, ensuring thorough understanding of challenging concepts or vocabulary.                                                                 |
