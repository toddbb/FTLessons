| Stage                         | Timing  | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                        | 10 mins | Begin with a fun brainstorming activity. Write "money" on the board and ask students to shout out types of money they know. Transition to digital currencies and take note of any prior knowledge. Create a welcoming environment where students feel positive about contributing ideas. Use a web-based tool like Mentimeter to visualize their input, helping to set a collaborative tone for the class.                                                                               | Encourage all answers, reinforcing that there's no right or wrong at this stage. Use students' contributions as a springboard to the lesson topic. Aim to make a visual web of their ideas to anchor discussions.                                                                                                             |
| Lead-In / Set Context         | 10 mins | Introduce a short, engaging video clip that provides a simple explanation of what cryptocurrency is, using visuals to illustrate digital transactions. Follow up with questions to activate prior knowledge, e.g., "Have you heard of Bitcoin?" This method links students’ world to the lesson topic, setting a relevant and engaging context. Ensure students discuss in pairs their initial thoughts on digital money, promoting early peer interaction.                                                 | Use visuals or subtitles for support. Highlight key terms during the video and follow up with clarifying explanations if needed. Ask questions that promote students’ critical thinking about what they just observed.                                                                                                          |
| Present Model                 | 15 mins | Display a basic infographic showing how cryptocurrency transactions work. Model the process by narrating how a transaction takes place, highlighting the journey from a digital wallet to a confirmation on the blockchain. Task students with identifying the sequence of steps by examining the infographic. Facilitate student interactions by having them work in small groups to discuss and organize the process steps, using the visual aids as guidance.                                      | Emphasize interactive participation by having students share aloud their interpretations of the infographic process. Resolve any misconceptions by re-illustrating parts of the transaction process as necessary.                                                                                                               |
| Useful Language               | 15 mins | Use a vocabulary game to solidify understanding of key terms. Create a "Cryptocurrency Bingo" with vocabulary words like "wallet" and "transaction". Students listen for definitions read aloud by the teacher and mark their cards. When they get a bingo, they explain the terms in their row. This game-based format motivates and reinforces language learning through active engagement, while contextualizing vocabulary with real implications in cryptocurrency.                        | Pre-teach essential language for explaining the terms (e.g., "A wallet is..."). Provide visual aids or sentence starters to scaffold learning. Encourage peer support by allowing students to discuss possible definitions with a partner before responding.                                                                         |
| Preparation                   | 15 mins | Organize students into small groups to prepare a brief skit showing a digital purchase using cryptocurrency. Assign roles such as buyer, seller, and digital wallet. Provide time to discuss and write their dialogues, focusing on using the target vocabulary and clearly conceptualizing the transaction flow. This balance between guided planning and independent creation helps students generate meaningful dialogue in a structured setting.                                        | Distribute sentence starters and visual role cards to facilitate dialogue writing. Conduct a brief modeling of a skit to illustrate expectations. Monitor closely, providing feedback and support when necessary to ensure all voices are included.                                                                               |
| Complete Task                 | 35 mins | Groups present their skits to the class. Each group performs while others observe how they use vocabulary and manage the transaction process. After each performance, the audience asks questions or offers praise, fostering a community of supportive, constructive peer feedback. This extended activity promotes fluency, allowing students to grow comfortable articulating their knowledge and enhance confidence discussing digital finance in real scenarios.                                  | Facilitate respectful peer feedback, emphasizing constructive praise and questions that push for deeper understanding. Remind the audience to note vocabulary use and interaction dynamics. Assess how students process feedback with quick, reflective questions, aiding in their conceptual development of the lesson.                  |
| Feedback/Error Correction     | 15 mins | Engage students in a reflective error correction session using anonymous examples from skits. Highlight successful vocabulary use and clarify common errors, prompting self-correction where possible. Contrast correct and incorrect examples through shared class discussion, ensuring students understand improvements. Use supportive language and encourage students to share personal improvement goals, fostering a growth mindset.                                         | Start with positive reinforcement, acknowledging effective communication and language use. Encourage students to express how they might self-correct in future scenarios. End with a class reflection about what was learned, to solidify understanding and commitment to improvement.                                           |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)   | 5 mins  | Open time for unanswered questions or inquiries related to the topic, ensuring any lingering doubts are addressed. Encourage students to voice thoughts freely, solidifying understanding and application of discussed concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Use this time to support individual questions, clarify points of confusion, or extend discussion for enthusiastic students. Reinforce the shared goal of understanding and confidence in using cryptocurrency vocabulary.                                                                                                       |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Pair stronger speakers with those who might need more support during group activities. Use flashcards with visual aids to support learners who benefit from visual learning.
- Common Pitfalls: Clarify the distinction between digital wallets and physical wallets early on to avoid confusion.
- Classroom Management: Provide a clear set of rules and expectations for group work to ensure collaborative efforts remain focused and respectful.
