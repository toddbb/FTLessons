### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                 | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description** |

|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Warmer**                | 10 mins   | To start the lesson, students will play a quick game of "Environmental Bingo". Each student receives a bingo card with different environmental actions (e.g., recycling, using a bike, planting trees). The teacher calls out scenarios or actions, and students mark their cards. The first to complete a row shouts "Bingo!" and shares which actions were called. This activity builds rapport, encourages interaction, and introduces key vocabulary contextually. Scaffolding includes visual aids on the board, modeling the first round, and peer support as students explain their strategies to those who don't understand. Formative assessments are done by asking questions about their understanding of terms during the game. | 

| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins   | Students watch a short video clip on climate change and sustainability. They then discuss in pairs: "What did you find interesting?" and "Have you seen similar issues in your community?" The teacher models answering these questions briefly to guide students. To scaffold, a graphic organizer is provided to help organize their thoughts, including prompts like "I learned that...", "It surprised me that...", etc. Students then share their discussions with the entire class, and the teacher asks probing questions to deepen understanding and fill any gaps in comprehension. Content check for understanding ensures students’ engagement and identifies any vocabulary needing clarification. | 

| **Present Model**         | 15 mins   | The teacher plays an audio clip of a conversation between two peers discussing sustainable practices, pausing intermittently to highlight language structures used. Students follow along with a transcript handout, identifying key phrases and structures. Teacher models sentence stress and intonation with selected sentences, prompting choral repetition. To scaffold, students are tasked initially with identifying specific language use. They then practice in pairs, using a sentence starter handout. The teacher circulates, providing feedback and further modeling as needed. A quick comprehension check is conducted by asking students to summarize key points in pairs, refining understanding and confirming grasp of the models. | 

| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins   | The class engages in a "Vocabulary Relay Race" to solidify new vocabulary. Students are divided into teams, and each team member takes turns running to the board to match flashcards containing environmental terms with their definitions. The game encourages peer support and quick recall. Teachers ensure all students participate, providing sentence starters like "This word means..." to aid those struggling. Vocabulary flashcards are used as visual aids, and the teacher models pronunciation prior to the game. Regular formative checkpoints include quick quizzes and post-race, debriefing with questions to confirm understanding of vocabulary meanings and usage. | 

| **Preparation**           | 15 mins   | Students work in small groups to prepare a short presentation about a sustainable innovation or practice. Teacher provides a graphic organizer to help them structure their ideas, covering aspects like "Problem", "Solution", "Benefits". The teacher encourages students to use the target language, and model examples are provided. Peer feedback cycles, facilitated by providing feedback forms with sentence starters (e.g., "I liked how you explained...", "One thing you might add is..."), help refine their plans. Teacher circulates, offering guidance and ensuring groups are on task. Regular check-ins ensure all understand their roles and objectives within their groups. | 

| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins   | Groups present their sustainable innovations to the class. During presentations, peers use provided checklist handouts for noting language use (e.g., modal verbs, persuasive language) and content strength. After each presentation, the class provides positive feedback and constructive suggestions. Teacher facilitates using question prompts ("How might this idea be implemented in our community?"), fostering a discussion loop. Direct feedback from peers creates a collaborative learning atmosphere, encouraging active, student-centered discussions. The teacher observes and notes language usage for later error correction in the next activity. | 

| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | The teacher reviews common errors heard during presentations, writing them on the board without naming students. The class corrects them together, discussing why each is incorrect and how it could be improved. During this stage, the teacher provides examples of exemplary language use observed, reinforcing positive models. Formative assessment is achieved by checking corrections and clarifying any confusion about language rules or vocabulary. Student interaction remains high as students are encouraged to propose corrections and justify their choices. | 

| **Flex-time/Buffer**      | 5 mins   | If time permits, the class engages in a "Sustainability Quiz" on an online platform like Kahoot!, revisiting the day's vocabulary and content with engaging questions. This quick wrap-up offers a formative check of students' retention and understanding, reinforcing the learning objectives through exciting, game-based interaction. |

#### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use mixed-level pairs and groups to balance stronger and weaker students, facilitating peer learning. Provide additional language support for lower-level students with tailored sentence starters and visual aids. Allow stronger students to lead discussions or model activities after initial teaching.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with technical terms related to environmental science. Break down complex vocabulary using simpler synonyms initially, followed by peer explanation opportunities.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain clear signals for transitions between activities to manage energy levels effectively, and use proximity to manage group dynamics.
