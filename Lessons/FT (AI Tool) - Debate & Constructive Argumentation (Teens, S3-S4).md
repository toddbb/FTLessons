### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins | Begin with an interactive game where students match emojis to expressions (e.g., 😊 for "I agree"). This helps students associate facial expressions with debate phrases. Use magnetic emojis on the board, encouraging students to come up and match them while saying the corresponding phrase aloud. The teacher models first, demonstrating the alignment of expressions and ensuring understanding. This activity promotes engagement and builds comfort in using specific vocabulary. Check student comprehension regularly, asking questions like “What does this face say?” to ensure early understanding. |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins | Use a short, engaging video clip showing a debate scene suitable for the age group (e.g., a friendly discussion from a teen show). Ask students to note down any English words they hear related to argument and persuasion. After watching, conduct a brief class discussion: "Which words did you hear?" "What do you think was the main argument?" This activates prior knowledge and sets a contextual basis. Use visuals or a concept map on the board to structure their inputs, prompting students with questions to guide the exploration of ideas. |
| Present Model                | 15 mins | Introduce a debate model using a simple script where two characters present and defend their viewpoints on a relatable topic, such as “Should school start later?” Distribute scripts and have pairs read aloud. One student is “pro,” the other “con,” ensuring each experiences both roles. During reading, pause to highlight essential phrases with student input on meaning and usage. Ask comprehension questions about the role of each argument in the discussion. Encourage students to annotate key language structures collaboratively. |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins | Play "Debate Bingo," with cards containing phrases like “In my opinion,” “I disagree because,” and “That’s a good point, but.” As students listen to each other’s example arguments, they mark phrases heard. Create a fun atmosphere by turning phrase recognition into a race; the first to get a bingo calls out a unique phrase for the group to address, prompting spontaneous language use. During the game, circulate to provide feedback on language and offer scaffolds like sentence starters. Use peer support to encourage students to assist one another in finding expressions. |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins | In pairs, students choose a debate topic from a list (e.g., "Are games better than books?"). Provide graphic organizers to help them plan their arguments with sections for main points and supporting reasons. Ensure students use sentence starters and phrases from Useful Language. Offer guided practice by circulating and assisting pairs with language support, correcting where necessary, and providing formative feedback. Encourage peer assessment within pairs to refine arguments before presenting. |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins | Conduct a class debate using a structured format. Split the class into two groups with assigned viewpoints. Each group organizes their points, nominates speakers, and engages in a timed debate, using sentence starters and expressions learned. Encourage active listening by assigning students to note one point they agree or disagree with and why. After debates, hold a brief reflection session on what went well and areas for improvement. Teacher listens for accuracy and fluency, taking notes for later feedback. Utilize peer feedback techniques where students comment constructively on each other's performance. |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins | Conduct a feedback session, first highlighting successful uses of language, structure, and interaction observed during debates. Use a plus/delta method (positives and changes). Personalize feedback, giving examples of effective language use and suggesting alternative expressions. Gather student thoughts on challenging aspects and address these with targeted mini-lessons or clarifications. Invite questions or comments from students to promote interactive learning. Emphasize shared improvement and cooperation for next time. |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)  | 5 mins  | Allow time for any emergent questions or additional feedback. Offer individualized support for students needing extra help with specific language structures. Use this time for follow-up questions to encourage deeper thinking about language use in debates. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Pair stronger students with those needing support for scaffolded peer learning.
- Management: Encourage respectful listening and feedback among students during debates.
- Common pitfalls: Watch for over-reliance on "I think" without support. Reinforce reasons and examples.
