| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins  | Begin with a quick game of "World Map Bingo" to introduce countries. Each student receives a bingo card with country names. Display a large world map. Call out country names and have students mark the spots on their cards. The first person to get five in a row shouts "Bingo!" to win a small prize. This activity uses peer collaboration and visual aids, reducing teacher talk and encouraging student engagement. Teacher will address pronunciation of country names, embedding stress patterns in speech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Lead-In/Set Context**     | 10 mins  | Show a series of pictures of famous landmarks around the world (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Great Wall of China). Facilitate a guided discussion with questions like "Where is this?", "Have you heard of it?", "What would you do if you visited?". Prompt students to think about personal experiences or knowledge about these places. Use visual aids and sentence starters to support responses. Encourage group discussion to activate prior knowledge, following up with comprehension checks and prompting elaboration using essential travel-related vocabulary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins  | Introduce a short video of a travel blogger discussing their experiences in famous cities. As students watch, they complete a checklist of features mentioned (foods, activities, expressions). After viewing, engage students with open-ended questions: "What did the blogger like about each place?", "How did they compare with other places?". Model language used in video with examples, emphasizing sentence starters and key phrases. Use guided peer work to discuss which place they'd like to visit and why, gradually releasing responsibility to students for independent production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins  | Introduce a game-based activity using a "Travel Matching Game". Students receive flashcards with words and definitions. In pairs, they match vocabulary like "museum," "cuisine," "landscape," and "heritage" to their definitions. Completion of matches signals the start of a timed race where pairs must use each word in a sentence describing a country. Progressively release responsibility by first modeling how to use the words, then providing guided practice and finally having students work independently. Conduct formative assessments using visual checks as pairs present their sentences. Include peer feedback opportunities where students exchange sentences with another pair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins  | Explain an upcoming "Travel Debate" role-play. Each student selects a country to represent. Provide planning sheets with prompts (e.g., "My country is best because...", "You should visit us for..."). Using graphic organizers, students note down key points about their country. During this preparation phase, circulate to provide sentence starters and prompting questions, ensuring scaffolding for language structure and vocabulary usage. Students work with peers to refine their arguments under supervision, ensuring continuous scaffolding and support. Assess students' preparedness through one-to-one questioning, verifying comprehension of task expectations and language required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins  | Conduct the "Travel Debate" through a structured role-play. Students present their country's merits, using persuasive language and comparison structures. Divide the class into small groups for these debates and assign turns for presentations. While each student debates, peer listeners are tasked with noting down two reasons for visiting the presented country. Encourage the class to ask questions or challenge points, fostering an engaging and interactive environment. Throughout, offer feedback and correct language use in real-time, emphasizing fluency and confidence. Conclude with votes on which country was most persuasive. Take notes on language errors and impressive usage for feedback and reinforcement in the following stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins | Provide collective, constructive feedback focusing on pronunciation, fluency, and use of vocabulary. Use specific examples from performances to highlight achievements and areas for improvement. Conduct whole-class error correction based on notes taken during the debate. Use visual aids, like corrected sentences and highlighted vocabulary, reinforcing correct language forms. Encourage peer-feedback by inviting students to share what they found impressive. Wrap up with motivational comments, ensuring positive reinforcement of newly acquired skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)** | 5 mins   | Utilize this time to revisit any emergent queries or provide an additional fun discussion about dream travel destinations. Employ open-ended questions to foster spontaneous conversation. Adjust instructional strategies based on observed needs, maintaining an emphasis on communicative practice and learner autonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Tailor vocabulary complexity for mixed proficiency levels. Allow students to choose their level of detail in descriptions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Monitor over-reliance on teacher support in debate. Aim for scaffolding that encourages independence over time.
- **Classroom Management:** Use flexible grouping for the debate to maintain engagement. Ensure respectful communication is maintained during discussions.
