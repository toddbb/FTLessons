|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Begin with a quick icebreaker related to job experiences. Ask students to briefly share a memorable job they had in the past, encouraging group interaction. Use this to introduce the topic of CV writing and interviews, creating a positive and comfortable atmosphere. Utilize visual aids to display common job-related vocabulary to get them thinking about the language they will encounter.                                                                                                                                                                         | Encourage all students to share, regardless of language level, and provide verbal prompts as needed to facilitate conversation. Use supportive visuals to minimize teacher talk. |

| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins    | Display a slide with images of different CV styles from various countries. Discuss with students what makes a CV effective. Pair students and ask them to compare two CVs, focusing on layout, language, and relevance to the job description. Have pairs share their findings with the class. This will set the context for analyzing how international CVs differ and what makes them stand out.                                                                                                                                                   | Use guiding questions like "What stands out?" and "What would you change?" Encourage students to use specific language to describe CV features.                           |

| **Present Model**         | 15 mins    | Present an authentic high-quality CV and analyze each section. Highlight useful phrases for describing achievements and skills. Ask students to identify key language structures. Divide the class into small groups and give each group a different section of the CV to analyze (e.g., Objective, Experience). Groups present their analysis, focusing on language structures such as present perfect for recent achievements and past simple for completed experiences.                                                                                                                         | Model specific examples using the board to illustrate language points. Reinforce key grammar and vocabulary connections, checking comprehension through Q&A.        |

| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins    | Engage students in a competitive game titled "Build Your CV!" Divide the class into teams. Provide each team with cut-out phrases and words necessary for a CV. Teams must arrange them in the correct order and within the appropriate sections of a CV. This activity will review vocabulary and reinforce the format of a CV. Include specific vocabulary and set time limits to increase the challenge. Celebrate the winning team.                                                                                                                                                 | Monitor groups, offer hints or corrects mistakes using visual prompts. Highlight the correct grammar and usage through examples. Provide phrase banks for support.  |

| **Preparation**           | 15 mins    | Instruct students to begin drafting their own CV. Use a template handout to guide them through filling out sections with personalized content. Provide students with a vocabulary gloss useful for describing skills and achievements. Walk around, offering personalized feedback and checking for appropriate language and structure. Encourage the use of specific verbs and quantifiable achievements.                                                                                                                                                        | Assist students individually to ensure proper understanding. Use sentence starters to help less confident students compete for their drafts. Provide encouragement and affirm abilities. |

| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins    | Organize a role-play where students practice interview scenarios. Pair students, with one acting as the interviewer and the other as the applicant. Provide role cards outlining specific questions to be asked. Encourage students to use the vocabulary and structures learned during CV writing to respond. Rotate partners to ensure diverse interaction and continuous practice of language within different contexts. Use checklists for interview criteria. End with peers providing constructive feedback.                                                                                    | Emphasize fluency over accuracy; mark positive language used. Remind students to incorporate authentic language. Provide additional prompts to support the learners as needed.           |

| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Facilitate a group feedback session where students reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Use specific examples from the role-play sessions. Correct common errors seen in the CV drafts or heard in interviews. Reinforce learning by highlighting examples of good practice and providing clear suggestions for improvement. Allow students to ask questions and clarify doubts. Encourage self and peer-correction techniques.                                                                                                                                                                             | Offer praise for correct usage. Use errors as teachable moments. Push for self-correction by asking leading questions. Utilize mini-whiteboards for visible corrections.              |

| **Flex-time/Buffer** | 5 mins | Address any emergent questions or concerns from the students. This time can be used to revisit any stage of the lesson that requires further work or clarification. Alternatively, it might be used to extend the role-play or give students extra time to refine CVs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Use this time wisely to alleviate any confusion. Provide individual assistance where necessary. Encourage further independent practice beyond classroom activities.          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Pair strong and weaker students together for peer support. Adjust the complexity of vocabulary tasks based on student proficiency.
- Pitfalls: Avoid overwhelming students with too much vocabulary. Break down activities into manageable parts and ensure comprehension at each step.
- Classroom Management: Keep a careful watch during role-play activities to maintain engagement and ensure equal participation.
