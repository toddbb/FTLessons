|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins    | Begin with an ice-breaker game where students pair up and share their dream jobs. Each student then introduces their partner's dream job to the class. This game fosters peer interaction and sets a relaxed atmosphere. Scaffold with job title flashcards and gestures to guide understanding.                                                        | Use visual prompts, such as emojis or job icons, to aid comprehension. Encourage students to use full sentences like "My partner's dream job is...".                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins    | Show pictures of well-organized CVs and ask students, "What do these have in common?" Elicit responses about the structure and purpose of a CV. Use guiding questions to activate prior knowledge. Introduce the lesson context: creating an impressive CV for international employers.                                                               | Ask questions like, "Why is a CV important?" and "What information do you see on a CV?" Use real-world examples to explain relevance.                                                                                                                          |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins    | Present a sample CV on a projector or screen. Highlight each section (personal details, education, skills, achievements). Students engage in a matching activity where they match vocabulary with CV sections. For example, match "Education" with a list of schools, "Skills" with specific abilities.                                               | Encourage questions about the sample CV. Use a think-aloud protocol to model how to analyze the CV's structure and content.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins    | Conduct a digital quiz on career-related vocabulary using Kahoot. Students race against time to choose the correct meaning or use of words. Words include "achievement," "responsibility," "goal," "experience." This gamified activity enhances engagement and retention. Provide feedback after each question to consolidate understanding.                 | Set clear expectations about rules. Emphasize speed and accuracy. Provide immediate, clear feedback after each question.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins    | Students work in pairs to brainstorm their skills and achievements. Provide a graphic organizer to outline each section of their sample CV. Use sentence starters like "I am good at..." or "I have experience in..." to assist. Encourage students to ask each other questions to refine their ideas and language.                                   | Walk around and monitor progress, providing assistance as needed. Encourage students to elaborate on each point, prompting with questions.                                                                                                                     |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins    | Organize mock interview role-play. One student is the interviewer, and the other is the applicant. Provide role-play scripts featuring common interview questions. Encourage the use of newly learned vocabulary and sentence structures. Students switch roles halfway through. Scaffold with sample answers for each question.                                | Model an example role-play with a volunteer first. Emphasize the importance of eye contact and clear speech. Correct pronunciation and intonation gently during the practice.                                                                                  |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins  | Facilitate a class discussion on the role-play experiences. Provide corrective feedback on common errors heard in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary use. Reinforce positive behaviors like attempting complex sentences or using new vocabulary. Conclude with a reflection activity where students share what they learned and enjoyed today.                                | Highlight examples from student performances. Use a positive tone to encourage continued practice. Offer individual tips for improvement where necessary.                                                                                                       |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins     | Wrap up with a quick recap of the new vocabulary learned and a motivational talk about how mastering these skills boosts employability globally. Allow time for any remaining questions or clarifications.                                                                                                                                        | Use this time flexibly to address specific emergent needs or enhance engagement with a quick, fun review game if time allows.                                                                                                                                |
