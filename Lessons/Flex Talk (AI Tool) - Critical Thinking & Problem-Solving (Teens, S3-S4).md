### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                  | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description and Instructions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Begin with an engaging "What Would You Do?" game. Present students with a humorous or exaggerated problem on the whiteboard (e.g., "You find a talking cat in your garden. What do you do?"). Encourage pairs to discuss and come up with creative solutions. Prompt laughter and creativity, and then have a few pairs share their solutions with the class. This builds rapport and energizes the group.                           | Use visuals to make the scenario more engaging. Ensure each student participates and expresses their thoughts with a partner to ensure equal opportunity.                                         |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Use a short, entertaining video clip (2-3 minutes) showing someone solving an everyday problem creatively (e.g., using a clever hack in a kitchen). After viewing, ask students to identify what the problem was and how it was solved. Initiate a class discussion with questions like, "Have you ever solved a problem like this?" to activate prior knowledge and set the context for critical thinking.                       | Pause and ask comprehension questions to check understanding, such as, "What was the main issue in the video?" Use gestures and visuals for clarity.                                             |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Provide a model by demonstrating a problem-solving process on the whiteboard. Outline steps like Identifying the Problem, Brainstorming Solutions, Choosing the Best Solution, and Evaluating the Outcome. As you demonstrate, involve students by asking questions like, "What could be another solution here?" and "Why might this solution work well?" Ensure understanding by providing a clear model.                     | Use think-aloud strategies to model thought processes. Encourage student input by asking questions that require critical thinking and reasoning, allowing them to engage actively.                |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Conduct a vocabulary matching game. Provide students with a handout of key vocabulary and definitions (e.g., "analyze," "debate," "solution"). Students work in small groups to match words with definitions. Use cards and play a timed game for competitive fun. After the game, regroup for a quick review ensuring everyone is clear on meanings and correct pronunciation as modeled.                                  | Incorporate peer support by allowing students to discuss answers in pairs before a whole-class review. Use frequent checks and prompts to ensure understanding and correct pronunciation.          |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Introduce a collaborative puzzle-solving activity focused on arranging pieces to visualize a problem-solving sequence. Students work in small teams to organize laminated cards representing different problem-solving steps. Encourage discussion within teams about each step's significance. This fosters collaboration and deepens understanding of systematic problem-solving processes.                                          | Assign roles like scribe or speaker to ensure participation. Use formative assessments by circulating and listening to group discussions, providing immediate feedback and clarifying misconceptions.|
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Conduct an interactive problem-solving role-play game. Present a specific scenario (e.g., "Your school's sports day is canceled due to rain. What do you do?") and have students work in groups to develop a plan. Students then role-play, presenting and defending their solutions to the class. Use debate formats to allow opposing solutions to be considered, promoting student interaction and engagement with feedback.          | Use graphic organizers for structuring debate arguments. Encourage use of target language by providing sentence starters and error corrections during role-plays. Promote peer feedback for further learning.       |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Conclude with constructive feedback focusing on language use, coherence, and creativity of solutions. Highlight effective use of vocabulary and grammar during role-plays. Address common errors observed, use anonymous examples for correction. This reinforces language skills and provides students with strategies for future tasks. Conduct a reflective session where students share insights learned about problem-solving.                            | Use positive reinforcement to encourage continuous learning. Adopt error-correction techniques that are sensitive, focusing on collective learning rather than individual mistakes.               |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Use this time to address any emergent questions or reinforce key concepts. Offer additional challenges or reflective prompts to extend learning if time allows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Be flexible and attentive to students’ immediate needs. Encourage sharing of any real-life problems they may be facing and how the lesson could apply.                                            |

### Teacher Notes and Tips

- Differentiation Strategy: Pair stronger students with weaker ones to facilitate peer learning. Use visuals and simple language to aid understanding for lower-level students.
- Common Pitfall: Students might struggle with articulating their ideas. Provide sentence starters and allow time for rehearsal.
- Classroom Management: Use clear instructions and consistent signals to manage transitions. Monitor group work actively to maintain focus.
