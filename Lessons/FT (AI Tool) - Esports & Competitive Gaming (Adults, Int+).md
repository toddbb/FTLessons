| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Begin with a quick ice-breaker game called "Name That Game!" Display images of different popular video games. Students work in pairs to guess the names and main genres of the games. Elevate energy and awaken prior knowledge.                                                                                                 | Encourage students to focus on game genres and themes. Allow for guesses and prompt discussion on any known facts about each game.         |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Show a short video clip demonstrating an exciting moment in a professional esports tournament. Engage students by asking them to share any video games they play. Discuss briefly the competitive aspect of gaming.                                                                                                            | Ask open-ended questions to activate their knowledge on gaming culture. Avoid long monologues; focus on student discussions.             |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Present a model dialog between two players discussing a recent esports event. Provide students with a task to identify positive and negative opinions in the dialog. Students listen and then conduct a short role-play of the dialog, practicing swapping opinions.                                                          | Tape scripts of the dialog on the board for reference. Include sentence starters and frames for clarity.                                  |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Create an interactive game-based activity using an online platform. Introduce key vocabulary like "tournament," "streamer," "strategy," and practice pronunciation in pairs. Engage students in a competitive vocabulary quiz to reinforce retention through collaboration.                                                         | Incorporate visuals and provide clear definitions with examples. Utilize peer feedback for immediate pronunciation correction.            |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| Students form small groups and choose a popular game to discuss. Each group prepares a short presentation addressing the game's impact, its strategies, and its place in esports culture. Provide a structured framework to help plan their speaking points fluently.                                                              | Supply graphic organizers to structure thoughts. Walk around and listen to formulate language scaffolding for different group needs.      |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Conduct a collaborative speaking task where groups present their chosen game. Encourage a Q&A session after each presentation. Focus on fluency and clear delivery. Support self and peer-assessment by listening for specific language points discussed.                                                                            | Confirm active listening strategies by noting points on the board. Keep engagement high with incentives for creative discussions.         |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins| Facilitate a whole class session using examples from the presentations. Highlight successful language use while offering correction tactically where needed. Initiate open reflection on what was learned about esports culture and language. Discuss any challenges faced in communication efforts.                                    | Use visual aids and teacher echoing to model corrections. Offer praise for progress, further encouraging language exploration.            |
| Flex-time/Buffer             | 5 mins | Provide additional time for any missed reflections or to address emergent questions. Optional "turn and talk" activity if additional time remains, using questions like "What surprised you the most about esports?"                                                                                                              | Ensure that any new questions are acknowledged and attempted to be answered, solidifying student curiosity and understanding.            |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use differentiated tasks according to students' comfort with gaming. Encourage novice players to focus on aspects of video gaming culture they feel most familiar with.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid overwhelming students with excessive technical jargon. Simplify complex concepts without taking away the enthusiasm of gaming discussions.
- **Classroom Management:** Monitor student participation closely; ensure that all voices are heard, especially quieter students.
