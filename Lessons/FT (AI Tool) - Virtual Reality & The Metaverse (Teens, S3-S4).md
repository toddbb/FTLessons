### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                       | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description** |

|---------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|

| **Warmer**                      | 10 mins    | Begin with a fun, interactive "Technology Bingo" game to engage students. Students will have a bingo card with words related to technology, such as "VR," "avatar," and "metaverse." As you read out definitions or sentences hinting at these words, students mark their cards. This activity sets a lively tone and encourages students to recall any prior knowledge they have about technology vocabulary. Use gestures, visuals, and simple definitions to aid comprehension. Highlight energy and reinforcement through peer interaction. Students will shout "Bingo!" when they have a full row, facilitating vocabulary reinforcement and excitement. |

| **Lead-In / Set Context**       | 10 mins    | Present a short video or slideshow of images showcasing VR and the metaverse in various contexts like gaming, education, and business. Ask students to brainstorm in pairs what they noticed in the visuals. Encourage them to speculate on what VR might be used for in the future. The aim is to activate prior knowledge and create curiosity about the topic. Monitor pair discussions, offering support and prompting further questions to guide their explorations. Additionally, quickly preview the lesson’s goals so students understand the direction of the lesson. |

| **Present Model**               | 15 mins    | Introduce students to a short dialogue between two characters discussing their experiences with VR. Display the dialogue on the board, highlighting target language and expressions. Invite a couple of students to role-play the dialogue to the class. To ensure understanding, stop at key expressions, demonstrate the pronunciation, and ask students comprehension questions. Then, pair students and have them practice the dialogue multiple times, encouraging them to swap roles. Providing sentence starters and visual prompts will support less confident students. Conclude this stage with a quick whole-class feedback session, checking understanding and agility in language use. |

| **Useful Language**             | 15 mins    | Introduce a game-based activity called "Vocabulary Relay." Split the class into small groups and give each a set of vocabulary cards. One student at a time races to the board holding a card, acts out or defines the word without speaking, while their team guesses. This activity fosters enjoyment and consolidation of vocabulary. To scaffold, display a list of possible verbs or adjectives that might describe or relate to VR and metaverse terms. This competitive structure motivates quick thinking and active use of language, while the team setup offers peer support. Conclude by reviewing any challenging terms. |

| **Preparation**                 | 15 mins    | Organize students into small groups and assign each group a scenario card, e.g., "Use of VR in a virtual classroom." Groups will brainstorm and chart ideas on how VR and the metaverse are utilizable in their given scenario. Use graphic organizers, like mind maps, to assist group planning. Encourage students to focus on vocabulary and language structures covered earlier. Walk around, offering ideas and prompting questions to deepen thought. Transition responsibility gradually, allowing students to steer their discussions. Encourage a brief oral synopsis of their scenario prep to the class, ensuring everyone knows what’s being planned. |

| **Complete Task**               | 35 mins    | Groups now role-play their scenarios, using language and ideas developed during the preparation phase. Allocate ample time for each group to present, encouraging them to use visuals or props if available. After each role play, other students can ask questions, prompting presenters to think on their feet and refine their communicative responses. Feedback should be peer-led initially, encouraging classmates to praise the role play and suggest improvements. This exercise consolidates the language learned and enhances fluency as students engage in meaningful, context-relevant dialogues. A teacher’s guided feedback follows, touching on fluency, pronunciation, and vocabulary use, ensuring all students can improve for future tasks. |

| **Feedback/Error Correction**   | 15 mins    | Conduct a whole-class feedback session. Highlight strong language use noted during presentations, using them as models. Address common or notable errors, analyzing them with the group. Focus on misconception correction and language accuracy. Prompt students to reflect on their performance in pairs, discussing how they felt and what aspects might improve. Use returned constructive feedback to correct, practicing ambiguous words or phrases together if needed. Encourage open sharing of thoughts and self-assessment within groups, fostering an environment of mutual learning and support. |

| **Flex-time/Buffer**            | 5 mins     | Create flexibility with a "Question Box" where students anonymously drop questions about today's topic or share personal thoughts on VR experiences. Encourage sincere inquiry by fielding questions, facilitating a quick discussion or expanding on lingering uncertainties. This time allows for addressing any immediate, emergent needs of the class, ensuring students leave with a clear understanding of the lesson's content and goals. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide extra support to struggling students using sentence frames and word banks. Encourage stronger students to use more complex language and justify their ideas in discussions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students might confuse similar technology terms. Use clear visuals and examples to distinguish between them.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure all students are actively participating, especially during group work. Assign roles if necessary to keep students engaged.
