Promote a comfortable environment. | Ensure inclusivity and sensitivity to emotions.    |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins  | Show a short video clip on emotional intelligence in the workplace (about 2-3 minutes). After watching, facilitate a whole-class discussion.

| Present Model             | 15 mins  | Display a series of situations where emotional intelligence is key. Use real-world examples, like conflict resolution in the workplace.

| Useful Language           | 15 mins  | Engage students in a vocabulary matching game. Provide a list of words and definitions related to emotional intelligence. Students work in pairs to match them correctly. Follow this with a pronunciation drill. Each pair then shares one word and its meaning with the class, providing an example sentence.                  | Circulate to support and correct as needed.        |
| Preparation               | 15 mins  | In groups, students create a short role-play scenario about resolving a conflict using emotional intelligence. Provide prompts and guidance, ensuring they incorporate new vocabulary and expressions related to empathy and understanding.
