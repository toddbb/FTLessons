### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                     | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins | Begin with a quick brainstorming session where students share experiences with writing or receiving emails. The teacher facilitates the discussion by asking guiding questions like, "What are some key differences between personal and professional emails?" This activity serves to activate prior knowledge while providing opportunities for casual dialogue. Students work in pairs to list key elements of a professional email on a whiteboard. Provide sentence starters for those who need them, and check understanding by asking for examples of specific email lines. This warm-up encourages peer collaboration and sets a comfortable tone for the session. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Introduce the topic by displaying authentic examples of professional emails (names and sensitive information removed). Guide students to identify key features and language use in pairs. Hand out email samples and ask students to highlight examples of polite language and structure. Use visual aids, like a checklist on a slide, to help students categorize email components: greeting, body, closing. Conduct formative checks by asking students to explain why certain phrases are used, ensuring comprehension of context and purpose. Foster a collaborative environment by having pairs discuss their findings. |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins | Provide a model email on a digital platform for students to analyze. Ask guiding questions to promote inductive learning, such as, "What phrases indicate formality?" Students work in groups to dissect the email, noting the sequence of parts: introduction, detailed request, polite closing. Use a graphic organizer to map these components. Interact with students, offering guidance where misunderstandings arise. Encourage groups to compare their analyses. This stage is crucial for modeling effective email writing, emphasizing student discovery and engagement. |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins | Engage students in a role-play game, "Email Negotiator," where they practice formulating polite requests and responses based on scenarios. Each pair receives a scenario card and constructs two professional email examples using the target language. Scaffold with sentence starters and provide a vocabulary list for common professional terms. Students role-play by exchanging emails and responding appropriately. Monitor and offer feedback on language use, ensuring students are crafting formal, polite communications. This game emphasizes practical application and reinforces language acquisition through a fun, interactive format. |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins | Allow students time to prepare their own professional email draft using a provided template. Encourage independent application of language learned. Guide students in outlining their email structure, suggesting they begin with a clear purpose, followed by detailed support, and a formal closing. Offer targeted assistance to improve accuracy. Students can refer back to handouts and their earlier notes. The transition from guided support to independent planning hones their skills with a focus on accuracy and fluency balance. |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins | Facilitate a peer review session where students exchange emails and provide constructive feedback. This activity promotes fluency and authentic communication by engaging students in real-world application. Set up a collaborative document where students can comment on email drafts. Encourage feedback on clarity, politeness, and structure. Provide a checklist for guidance on what to look for. As a class, discuss common patterns or issues identified during peer review. This collaborative exercise enhances editing skills and builds confidence in professional writing. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conduct a group discussion to reflect on the learning experience. Use examples from student emails to highlight strengths and common areas for improvement. Focus on positive language patterns while addressing frequent errors. Facilitate group brainstorming on alternative phraseology or improvements. Provide structured correction when needed, using a polite language checklist. This session solidifies students' understanding and reinforces their learning journey. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**      | 5 mins  | Address any emergent questions or recap the session if needed. Provide further individual assistance or touch on additional points of learning based on the students' needs. Encourage final reflections about the lesson content and plan for applications beyond the classroom. |
