### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                       | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                      | 10 mins    | Start with a fun icebreaker called "Two Truths and a Lie." Each student writes down two true statements and one false statement about themselves. They take turns sharing them, and the class guesses which is the lie. This activity encourages speaking from the very start, building rapport in a relaxed setting. Encourage students to listen attentively and ask follow-up questions, fostering a friendly environment.                                                | Gently encourage shy students to participate by starting with a statement of your own. Keep the atmosphere light and playful.                                                   |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**       | 10 mins    | Show a short video clip of people engaging in daily conversations. Ask students what they notice about how people greet each other or make small talk. Elicit answers and insights from students to activate their prior knowledge and connect them to the topic. Use this as a springboard to discuss the importance and components of everyday communication, guiding them towards understanding the lesson focus.                                               | Use visual aids to highlight key points and possibly provide a brief transcript of the video to support understanding.                                                          |
| **Present Model**               | 15 mins    | Play an audio clip of a conversation between friends meeting for coffee. Ask students to identify key phrases used for greeting, asking about someone’s day, and making small talk. Distribute a transcript and highlight essential phrases. Model pronunciation and intonation, allowing students to repeat after you. Encourage students to take note of how stress and intonation affect meaning and naturalness in conversation.                                          | Use a mix of teacher modeling and choral repetition. Pause the audio strategically to explain cultural nuances or contextual details.                                         |
| **Useful Language**             | 15 mins    | Engage students in a game called "Phrase Hunt." Provide students with a list of common phrases used in everyday communication. In pairs, they must find these phrases in context by listening to short audio excerpts or reading short dialogues. Once found, they practice using them in new sentences. The first pair to correctly use all phrases wins. This gamified activity helps reinforce language in a dynamic and collaborative way.                                     | Provide sentence starters and prompts to support students who may struggle. Monitor and offer feedback on pronunciation and usage.                                             |
| **Preparation**                 | 15 mins    | Have students plan a small role-play scenario in pairs. They will use the phrases from the “Phrase Hunt” to create a short conversation taking place at a café. Encourage them to think about the tone, setting, and relationship between speakers. Offer structure through graphic organizers to help students organize their ideas. Encourage creativity but maintain focus on natural use of language.                                 | Circulate and provide guidance as necessary, especially with students needing more support. Use formative questions to check understanding.                                    |
| **Complete Task**               | 35 mins    | Allow pairs to perform their role-plays in front of the class. Encourage the audience to listen for the use of target phrases and provide constructive feedback to performers. Use a peer feedback form to structure positive notes and areas for improvement. Repeat the performances with different partners to ensure varied practice and deeper engagement. This stage is essential for building fluency and spontaneous language use.                      | Minimize teacher interventions to maximize student interactions. Provide light facilitation and keep the focus on enhancing student fluency and confidence.                     |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**   | 15 mins    | Provide feedback on the role-plays. Highlight effective use of phrases and areas needing improvement. Use examples from students’ performances to discuss common pronunciation or grammatical challenges. Encourage self-correction and peer-correction where possible. Provide a brief summary of the key points discussed during the feedback session. This encourages reflection and reinforces learning.                                               | Use positive reinforcement to boost confidence. Address errors sensitively, ensuring students see them as opportunities for improvement.                                        |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**            | 5 mins     | Use this time for any questions or additional practice if needed. If time allows, conclude with a short, engaging activity like "Compliment Chain." Students sit in a circle and give compliments using target phrases, passing an imaginary baton to the next person after a phrase is used. This reinforces language in an uplifting, communal way and fills any leftover time usefully.                                                          | Ensure everyone is involved and actively participating. Use this practice to consolidate understanding or clarify lingering doubts.                                              |
