|-------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins    | Begin with a quick interactive quiz using a digital tool like Kahoot, focused on different types of green technologies. Examples: solar panels, wind turbines, etc. Encourage students to guess the function of each technology presented. This activity not only serves as an ice-breaker but also starts setting the context. The quiz will be followed by a brief discussion on which technologies the students are most familiar with. | Keep the tone light and engaging. Use images and short descriptions. Encourage pairs to discuss their experiences with any of the technologies.                                        |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins    | Introduce the topic by showing an engaging video clip (3-4 minutes) about a new green technology. Ask students to note down the key points and innovations they observe. After watching, conduct a class discussion where students can share their observations. Use a digital whiteboard to list down all the technologies and terms students mention and provide brief definitions or explanations.                              | Check understanding by asking questions. Use visuals to support explanations. Allow students to work in pairs for initial exchange of ideas before whole-class discussion.             |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins    | Read a short case study on a successful green innovation (e.g., Tesla’s electric cars) aloud. Have students follow along on their copies of the text. After reading, ask comprehension questions focusing on the usage of present perfect and passive voice in describing the technology's impact and development. Provide example sentences from the text, and have students highlight these structures.                      | Use choral reading to emphasize pronunciation. Scaffold by first analyzing models with the class. Provide highlighters for students to mark important structures in the text.          |
| **Useful Language Game**      | 15 mins    | Play a vocabulary game called "Green Bingo". Provide students with Bingo cards filled with terms related to sustainability. Call out definitions, and students find the corresponding terms on their cards. For each bingo, students must use the word in a sentence about innovation or green tech. This game allows students to actively practice and reinforce vocabulary understanding in an engaging manner.                     | Ensure vocabulary cards are B1/B2 appropriate. Encourage peer assistance for sentence formation. Monitor and provide corrections as needed.                                           |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins    | In small groups, students choose a green technology to research briefly using provided materials. They prepare a short oral presentation highlighting the technology's sustainable impact, innovation details, and benefits over traditional methods. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their presentations. Include key points such as problem addressed, technology description, and impact on the environment.                  | Circulate to provide support and guidance. Offer sentence starters and prompt questions to help students organize their thoughts. Reassure them that this is preparation for practice. |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins    | Students present their findings to the class in a "Green Tech Expo". Each group has 3-5 minutes for their presentation. Others take notes and ask questions. After each presentation, engage the class by asking clarifying questions and inviting reactions. Encourage critical thinking by having students evaluate which technology they believe has the most impact and explaining why.                           | Clearly outline the task and time management. Promote respectful listening and questioning. Encourage students to express agreement or ask for clarification where needed.              |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | After the expo, provide group and individual feedback. Highlight successful use of vocabulary and grammatical structures. Address common errors in structure or pronunciation with brief group mini-lessons or corrections. Use examples from the presentations without singling out students negatively.                                                                                                                               | Balance feedback to maintain confidence. Emphasize improvements. Encourage peer feedback sessions, where students can advise and positively critique one another.                       |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins     | Use this time to address any remaining questions or provide additional clarification on difficult concepts that emerged during the lesson. Consider revisiting particularly tricky vocabulary or grammatical structures if needed. This helps solidify understanding and ensure everyone leaves the lesson with clarity. Address queries related to sustainable innovations in different contexts.                        | Be flexible based on the needs of the class. Respond to any specific student inquiries. This can offer a more personalized touch to the lesson.                                         |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Provide vocabulary lists with example sentences for lower-level students and challenge higher-level students to find new examples of green technology independently.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students understand the difference between innovation and invention. Address misunderstandings regarding technical terminology.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage all students to participate by assigning roles in group work (e.g., note-taker, presenter).
