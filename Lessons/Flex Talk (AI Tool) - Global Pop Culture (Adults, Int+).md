#### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stages                        | Timing  | Extensive Activity Description and Instruction Tips |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins | Begin with a quick "Name That Tune" game using iconic soundtracks from global pop culture phenomena. Play brief clips and have students guess the show, movie, or artist. This fun, high-energy activity immediately engages students and prompts them to think about different aspects of pop culture they are familiar with, aiding in scaffolding. Follow up with brief pair discussions using prompts like "What was your first favorite TV show?" to activate prior knowledge and set a relaxed learning environment. Encourage informal sharing, scaffold responses by providing sentence starters (e.g., "I first liked... because...") and use visual aids to support understanding. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins | Set the context by showing a short engaging video compilation of globally popular entertainment such as K-pop music videos, anime scenes, or blockbuster movie trailers. Ask students to jot down any familiar terms or phrases they recognize. Follow with a brief discussion about the video, letting students share their initial thoughts, activating prior knowledge and personal connections. Use a mind-map on the board to organize ideas about what belongs to 'global pop culture,' drawing connections between different forms. Scaffold language by pre-teaching specific vocabulary related to cultural phenomena. |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins | The focus is on modeling conversations about pop culture. Use a role-play video where two people discuss their favorite shows and music. Before watching, provide students with a task to identify how the speakers express opinions and make comparisons. Afterward, discuss the video’s language aspects, focusing on identified grammar and vocabulary. Elicit student responses to ensure understanding. Use visual aids and sentence starters on the board, like "I prefer..., since..." or "In my opinion,..." to further guide learners. Regularly use comprehension checks by asking students to summarize sections of the dialogue. |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins | Implement a competitive game using Kahoot or Quizizz centered around vocabulary and phrases essential for discussing pop culture. This game-based activity enables students to learn through interaction. Include questions that require students to match words with definitions and use them in sentences. Essential vocabulary is displayed with pictures and basic definitions, reinforced through repetition and quick recalls. Post-game, clarify any misunderstandings and provide explicit pronunciation tips, especially focusing on stress patterns in compound nouns like 'K-pop'. |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins | Guide students in preparing for a discussion or mini-presentation about their favorite pop culture aspect. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their thoughts, ensuring they include key vocabulary, comparisons, and their opinion. Facilitate peer collaboration by having students practice with a partner, providing each other with feedback on clarity and language use. This stage transitions from guided to independent practice, gradually releasing responsibility. Teacher circulates to provide support and checks for comprehension. |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins | Students engage in a pair or group discussion, sharing their prepared topics. Encourage them to use the target language structures and vocabulary confidently. To maximize student talk and ensure equal participation, use a 'talking stick' or timer to manage turns. Collective feedback and correction are done afterwards, focusing on both content and language use. Monitor discussions, making note of successful usages and areas needing improvement. Utilize prompts strategically to facilitate deeper engagement. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conclude with a feedback session where the teacher shares observations from the discussions, spotlighting effective language use and areas for improvement. Use positive reinforcement to encourage participation. Address common errors, providing model corrections on the board. Highlight language strengths and guide further practice on particular challenges noted during the speaking task. Hand back student self-assessment sheets for reflection on their performance and progress. |

#### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide extra vocabulary support for students struggling with new terms. Allow more proficient students to lead discussions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students aren’t just reading scripts during discussions – encourage genuine interaction.
- **Classroom Management:** Keep energy levels high by setting clear time limits for tasks and transitions to keep up the momentum.
