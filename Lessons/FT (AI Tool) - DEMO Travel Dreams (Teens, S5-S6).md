### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with a map activity where students locate different countries. Use flashcards of countries and ask students to place them on the correct location on the map. This activity will not only activate students’ prior knowledge but also create a dynamic start to the lesson. Model the pronunciation of countries as needed. Students can work in pairs to support each other. Conduct a quick formative check by asking students to name a feature of a chosen country. This fosters engagement and sets up a positive learning environment. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a short video showcasing famous landmarks around the world. Pause the video at intervals and ask students questions about each location. Use sentence starters like “In this country, you can see…” to guide students’ descriptions. Conduct a think-pair-share activity where students discuss their favorite clip and why. Use visual aids to support understanding and ensure instructions are clear and concise to maintain the teacher-to-student talk ratio. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Present several postcards showcasing different countries. Have the students work in small groups to describe each postcard using comparatives and superlatives, clearly modeled by the teacher. Provide examples like “The Eiffel Tower is more iconic than the Statue of Liberty.” Allow students to note differences in architecture, food, and culture. Students will share their descriptions, receiving feedback to ensure correct language use. Use graphic organizers to scaffold language structures and provide guidance while groups present to extend learning. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Engage students in a game called “Travel Quest.” Students will use flashcards with different attractions and have to describe them to their peers using target language structures. Introduce key travel vocabulary through a matching game, where students connect terms with images. Provide hints and sentence starters. Use regular comprehension checks to ensure understanding and peer correction in a supportive manner. Explain game rules clearly, emphasizing speaking turns to increase fluency and maximize interaction. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | Have students individually choose a country they dream to visit and prepare a short presentation. Provide a template for structuring their presentation: introduction, main attractions, reasons for visiting, and comparison to other similar countries. Offer sentence frames and vocabulary lists to assist with language production. Set up peer review stations where partners can offer constructive feedback. Monitor groups, offering targeted support and ensuring equal participation. This supports scaffolding and gradual release of responsibility. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Conduct a "Travel Fair" where students present their chosen countries. Set up stations around the room where each student presents their country for 3-5 minutes. Use peer voting to make it competitive; students vote for the most convincing presentation. Encourage note-taking and active listening, reminding students to ask follow-up questions for clarity. Have students circulate, ensuring everyone interacts extensively. This increases engagement and allows students to demonstrate their speaking skills while fostering a supportive class environment. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide feedback through a "Compliment and Suggestion" session. Each student gives a compliment and a suggestion to their peers using sentence starters. This helps build a positive classroom environment and encourages constructive improvement. Monitor language use and step in to correct errors related to the target language. Highlight successful sentences for reinforcement. Use visual aids to recap common errors and share strategies for improvement. This feedback process is vital for reflection and future learning objectives. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer** | 5 mins | Use this time to address any emergent questions or clarify misunderstandings from earlier activities. Involve students in a reflective activity, like sharing one new thing they learned that day. This flexibility ensures all students are supported and their needs are met, wrapping up the lesson effectively. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Offer support based on individual student needs through targeted feedback during activities.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Be mindful of overuse of L1; encourage use of English through prompts and scaffolds.
- **Classroom Management:** Use proximity control and clear visuals to manage transitions smoothly.
