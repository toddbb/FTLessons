| Stage                          | Timing | Extensive Activity Description and Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                         | 10 mins | Begin with a game of "Cultural Bingo." Each student receives a bingo card with different cultural practices written on it (e.g., types of food, festivities). Students mingle around the classroom asking yes/no questions to find classmates who have experienced these practices, marking them off as they go. Use questions like "Have you ever tried sushi?" or "Have you celebrated Diwali?" This activity encourages speaking and breaks the ice. Scaffold by modeling how to ask questions and providing example responses. Formative assessment can occur as students share their findings with the class, promoting interaction. |
| Lead-In / Set Context          | 10 mins | Show a short video on global citizenship. The video features examples of teens taking action in their communities. After watching, ask students to discuss in pairs what they found interesting or surprising. Use prompts on the board to guide discussions, such as "What actions did you see?" and "How do these actions help?" This pairs interaction with visuals to set context. Monitor discussions, ensuring comprehension. Graphic organizers will help students note their thoughts for sharing later.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Present Model                  | 15 mins | Present a scripted role-play between two characters discussing cultural differences. Students listen and identify target language, focusing on modals and cultural vocabulary. Hand out dialogue transcripts and highlight parts illustrating the target structures. Students underline examples of modals used in giving advice or expressing obligation. The teacher models this process, thinking aloud to demonstrate comprehension strategies. Afterward, students reenact the dialogue to reinforce learning, practicing pronunciation and intonation. Comprehension checks involve questions like "Why should we respect cultural differences?" |
| Useful Language                | 15 mins | Play "Modal Match-Up," a card game where students match sentences using modals with appropriate advice or obligation phrases. Cards have scenarios like "Your friend wants to learn about different cultures" paired with "You should read more about them." This game focuses on peer collaboration and quick thinking. Teacher circulates, offering feedback and confirming correct usage. This interactive activity encourages sentence building and highlights functional language usage. Vocabulary cards will provide visuals for support, with checkpoints ensuring understanding of modal functions.                                                                                                |
| Preparation                    | 15 mins | In groups, students plan a short presentation on a cultural aspect or global issue of their choice. They use graphic organizers to structure their ideas and incorporate vocabulary and modals learned. Each group assigns roles: speaker, note-taker, and researcher. The teacher provides sentence starters and template sentences for presenting information, e.g., "We believe..." and "Our advice is..." This stage emphasizes collaboration, using peer feedback to refine presentations. Teacher circulates to offer guidance and ensure balanced participation, scaffolding with prompts where needed.                                                                              |
| Complete Task                  | 35 mins | Groups deliver their presentations to the class, fostering a speaking-focused environment. Peers assess using a checklist highlighting effective vocabulary use, pronunciation, and modality of expressions. Encourage students to ask questions and engage with each group’s topic. This interaction enhances critical thinking and fluency in real conversational settings. Teacher takes notes for feedback, ensuring focus remains student-centered. Encouraging peer questioning increases engagement, with individual and group praise promoted to support learning. A gradual release of responsibility involves teacher modeling, then stepping back.                                  |
| Feedback/Error Correction      | 15 mins | Provide feedback using examples from student presentations. Highlight strengths in vocabulary use and pronunciation while gently correcting frequent errors observed. Use a classroom chart to categorize common mistakes and ways to improve. Engage students by asking them to self-correct sentences or suggest better alternatives. This discussion helps consolidate learning, with visual aids reinforcing corrective strategies. Teacher notes any repetitive errors for future mini-lessons, providing immediate and constructive feedback focused on improving fluency and confidence.                                                                                                                |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)    | 5 mins  | Allow students to ask additional questions about cultural topics or discuss emergent concepts of interest. Encourage informal chat among students, practicing newly learned language in a relaxed setting. This optional period ensures flexibility, addressing any classroom needs or student curiosities, supporting ongoing comprehension and interest in the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation**: Use mixed-ability groups to balance strengths. Provide additional sentence starters or vocabulary for learners needing support.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Monitor overuse of certain modals. Reinforce understanding of when to use 'should' vs. 'must.'
- **Management**: Keep track of time during presentations, ensuring equal speaking opportunities.
