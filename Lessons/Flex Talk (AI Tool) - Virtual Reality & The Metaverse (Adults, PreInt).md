### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage | Timing | Extensive Activity Description and Instructions |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with a quick brainstorming activity on the topic of technology by asking students to share what comes to mind when they hear "virtual reality" and "metaverse". Use a whiteboard to capture their ideas. Encourage pair discussions and have them share with the class. This activates prior knowledge and gets students engaged. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a short video clip introducing VR and the metaverse. Afterwards, students discuss in pairs: "How do you think VR/metaverse will change in 10 years?" Provide sentence starters and vocabulary scaffolding. Conduct a brief class discussion to consolidate ideas. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Present a model dialogue between two characters discussing their first experience with VR and the potential business applications of the metaverse. Students listen for specific vocabulary and expressions. Pause frequently to check comprehension and clarify any uncertainties. Highlight the usage of Present Simple and Future Simple. Students then practice the model in pairs. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Engage students in a vocabulary matching game using flashcards. Words like "simulation", "immersive", and "avatar" are matched with definitions. In small groups, students categorize the words into those they know, don't know, and are unsure about. Teacher circulates, providing guidance and correcting pronunciation. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | Assign students to small groups to prepare a short presentation on "How VR/the metaverse could change our social lives or businesses." Provide a graphic organizer to help them structure their ideas. Encourage use of new vocabulary and stress proper sentence structure. Check-in with each group to support and suggest improvements. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Groups present their ideas to the class. Each group member should speak. Encourage attentive listening by having listeners ask questions. Provide formative feedback, focusing on fluency and use of target language. Start with positive observations, then suggest improvements. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conduct a feedback session focusing on common language errors noticed during presentations. Discuss effective strategies and corrections. Encourage peer feedback: "What did your peers do well?" Use this as a final opportunity to reinforce vocabulary and grammatical structures. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer** | 5 mins | Use any remaining time for an open Q&A where students can ask about vocabulary, grammar, or ideas related to the topic, or replay sections of the video for enhanced comprehension. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Pair stronger students with weaker ones for peer support during activities.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for overuse of Present Continuous instead of Present Simple.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure everyone participates by assigning specific roles within groups, such as timekeeper or note-taker.
