| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins| Begin the lesson with a quick quiz game about general technology knowledge. Divide the class into small groups and provide each with a set of questions relating to technology, such as "What is a URL?" and "What does Wi-Fi stand for?". Encourage lively debate and interaction within groups. Provide immediate feedback to generate interest and set a positive tone for the lesson. Integrate vocabulary like "phishing" so students begin informal exposure to target language.|
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins| Transition smoothly to cybersecurity by showing a short, engaging video that highlights real-life cybersecurity breaches. Facilitate a brief discussion where students can speculate and share their ideas about the importance of cybersecurity. Encourage students to share personal experiences or news they’ve heard relating to cyber threats. Use visual aids and prompts to scaffold understanding and engage students in predicting the lesson context.|
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins| Present a detailed case study of a fictional company that suffered a data breach. Distribute role-play cards depicting different characters from the company (e.g., CEO, IT manager, affected client). Set a task where students listen to a brief audio clip detailing their viewpoints and responsibilities post-breach. Have students note down key points. Model how to identify and summarize key information and opinions, pointing out specific language structures pertinent to giving opinions and reporting events. Encourage student predictions on potential consequences based on their role-play cards.|
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins| Conduct a lively game of "Cybersecurity BINGO," where students have bingo cards with cybersecurity vocabulary. Read out definitions or scenarios, and students must match these to their vocabulary cards. Allow them to confer with peers, fostering collaborative learning. Offer corrections and pronunciation modelling as words are called out. Use this stage to solidify vocabulary acquisition while making it interactive and enjoyable. Encourage students to offer sentences using each term, building confidence in usage.|
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins| Allow students to prepare arguments and highlights relating to their role-play character's perspective on the data breach. Provide sentence starters and prompts for structuring their ideas. Facilitate peer pair discussions for idea exchange and mutual support. Guide students to use target vocabulary accurately, ensuring they are clear on meaning and pronunciation. Offer an example presentation, emphasizing clarity and use of academic language. Conduct formative assessments by checking understanding through thumbs up/down or quick verbal feedback.|
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins| Organize the students into role-play groups, where they’ll conduct a meeting to resolve the fallout from the fictional data breach. Give each group a clear objective, such as drafting a cybersecurity action plan. Actively monitor and provide on-the-spot correction and support where needed, minimizing teacher talk to allow for maximum student interaction. Facilitate peer-driven discussions by encouraging questions and alternative viewpoints. Engage students with sentence stems to guide polite disagreement and clarification requests.|
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| Conclude with a whole-class feedback session. Allow students to reflect on their role-play performance and discussions. Encourage them to identify strengths and areas for improvement. Provide collective feedback on linguistic accuracy, such as common mispronunciations or grammatical errors. Highlight excellent vocabulary usage and encourage peer feedback. Use error examples from the task to model correct language use. Provide corrective feedback in a positive manner, ensuring students leave with actionable items for improvement.|
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)** | 5 mins | Use this time to revisit any questions or extend discussions on the topic, should the need arise. Offer additional examples or clarify any areas of confusion noted during the session. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation: Assign roles in the role-plays based on students’ confidence levels. Ensure lower-level students have simpler speaking roles, with supports like sentence starters.
- Common Pitfalls: Students may struggle with pronunciation of technical terms. Be prepared to offer additional practice and techniques for pronunciation.
- Classroom Management: Encourage peer correction and group interdependence to keep students engaged and thinking critically.
