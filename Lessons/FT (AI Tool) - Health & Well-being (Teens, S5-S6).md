| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins    | Begin with a simple icebreaker game called “Health Bingo.” Provide students with bingo cards containing health-related vocabulary words at their proficiency level. Students mingle to find peers who can talk about terms on their cards, marking them off as they go. Ensure each term appears at least once on different students' cards. As students fill their cards, they form quick pair discussions, exchanging information to clarify or negotiate meanings. This activity builds rapport and activates prior knowledge while encouraging peer interaction.                                                                                                                                                         | Model how to ask and answer questions with sentence starters like "Can you tell me about...?" or "What do you think of...?" Encourage interaction by moving around the room and participating briefly to monitor engagement.                                    |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins    | Introduce the topic using an engaging infographic on current fitness trends. Display the infographic and guide students to identify various health and wellness aspects depicted. Use questions like "What trends do you notice?" and "Why do you think these are popular?" to elicit responses. Encourage pair discussions, utilizing sentence starters such as "I noticed that..." or "In my opinion, this trend..." This process helps contextualize vocabulary in authentic settings, engaging students in critical thinking about health trends.                                                                                                                                         | Use visual aids to draw attention and maintain interest. Encourage students to use the target vocabulary in their discussions. Provide scaffolding through leading questions and prompts on the whiteboard.                                                     |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins    | Present a short video clip showing a conversation between two people discussing their health routines and wellness tips. Before playing, provide students with a task sheet containing specific details they need to listen for, such as types of exercises mentioned or specific diet tips. After the video, students discuss their findings in pairs or small groups, promoting active listening. This student-centered approach ensures they identify key language and integrate it with contextual meaning. The task also incorporates comprehension checks, promoting interactive learning and peer support.                                                                                          | Ellicit participation by asking students to predict content before watching. After viewing, facilitate discussions by pairing less confident learners with peer mentors. Use prompts like "Did you hear about...?" to guide the discussions.                     |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins    | Engage students in a word association game where they competitively match vocabulary cards with definitions related to health and wellness. Divide the class into small teams, and give each a set of cards. Students race to pair words with their definitions, using sentence structures like "This word means..." or "We use this term when talking about..." Monitor the activity to ensure accurate pairings while providing immediate feedback. This game enhances vocabulary retention and fosters a cooperative learning environment, strengthening language acquisition through repetition and peer support.                                                                                  | Simplify definitions for clarity. Monitor group interactions, offering hints if needed. Provide praise and reinforcement for correct matches to bolster confidence. Encourage learners to ask questions if unsure about definitions or word use.                  |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins    | Allow students time to individually plan a short presentation about a personal wellness routine or a favorite health trend. Provide a graphic organizer to help them structure their thoughts, including sections like "Introduction," "Main Activity," and "Benefits." Encourage the use of newly acquired vocabulary, promoting language accuracy and fluency. Pair students to practice their presentations, providing peer feedback based on clarity and the effective use of language. This gradual release strategy helps learners smoothly transition from guided preparation to more independent speech.                                                                                               | Support by showing an example presentation structure. Walk around, addressing questions and misunderstandings. Encourage students to use sentence frames like "Firstly,…" and "The reason I chose this is...". Provide feedback to guide revisions.               |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins    | Conduct a “Health Fair” where students confidently present their health routines or favorite trends to the class. Each presentation slot should allow for brief interactions where the audience poses questions or shares similar experiences. This format encourages real-life communicative use of language, while fostering a community atmosphere in which learners feel comfortable expressing ideas. The setup not only enhances speaking fluency and promotes interactive discourse but ties into listening and comprehension skills by involving all students in active participation.                                                                                                           | Encourage a positive, supportive environment. Offer prompts for asking questions and making comments, such as "I found your idea about... interesting, could you elaborate?" Provide formative feedback on language use and interaction techniques during the fair. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | After the health fair, lead a feedback session addressing common errors observed during presentations, offering constructive criticism on fluency, grammar, and pronunciation. Use specific examples from the fair, prompting students to rephrase incorrect statements. This reinforcement of learning assists in identifying and correcting inaccuracies without diminishing confidence. Conclude with a peer assessment activity where students exchange positive feedback and constructive suggestions on each other’s presentations, facilitating reflection and reinforcement of correct language use.                                                                                          | Deliver feedback using the "sandwich" method: positive note, constructive criticism, positive note. Encourage students to internalize corrections through repetition. Promote peer support by guiding students to provide meaningful, specific feedback to one another.  |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins     | Use this time to revisit any unclear points from the lesson or allow students to ask additional questions regarding the health topic. This buffer ensures all concepts are fully understood and provides a space for addressing emergent needs. Alternatively, facilitate a quick extension activity related to the health topic, such as a group challenge to brainstorm more health and wellness ideas in a competitive format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Stay attuned to class needs during flex-time. Encourage quieter students to voice any remaining questions. Offer applause for participation and efforts to foster a positive learning environment. Use additional time to launch follow-up topics or tasks.              |

- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing more support; Offer extra vocabulary cards for advanced learners.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Mispronunciation of complex vocabulary; Confusion between similar terms (e.g., wellness vs. fitness).
- **Classroom Management:** Foster a collaborative environment; Ensure all students have equal participation opportunities during activities.
