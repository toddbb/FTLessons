| Stage                       | Timing | Extensive Activity Description and Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins| Start the lesson with a game of "Guess the Game". Show students images of popular games and have them guess the name. This warms up their thinking about gaming and engages them immediately. Encourage students to pair up and discuss any games they recognize, building initial rapport and comfort. Scaffold by providing hints and prompts about the games if needed and model how to give supportive feedback to peers.                                 |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins| Introduce a short video clip showcasing an esports tournament. Ask questions to activate prior knowledge, like "Have you ever watched an esports game?" or "Do you have a favorite game?" This contextualizes the topic and engages interest. Use visuals and guiding questions to support understanding and provide vocabulary cards if necessary. Begin forming small discussion groups to facilitate interaction and peer support.                           |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins| Show a digital presentation that explains key aspects of esports, such as tournaments, teams, and strategies. Students receive a handout with fill-in-the-blanks to complete while watching. Provide clear examples and model pronunciation of new terms. Engage students by asking them to guess the meaning of terms from context. Use peer collaboration for stronger students to assist others, gradually shifting from teacher-led examples to student discoveries.         |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins| Play a game of "Esports Bingo". Provide students with bingo cards containing key vocabulary words. Call out definitions or example sentences, and students mark the correct word on their cards. This reinforces vocabulary learned and includes everyone in an active manner. Scaffold learning by providing sentence starters and allowing students to verify answers in pairs, promoting cooperative learning and checking understanding.                     |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins| In pairs, students prepare short presentations on their favorite game. Use graphic organizers to help them structure their ideas (e.g., game name, why they like it, key features). Offer sentence starters and visual prompts to guide their preparation. Use formative checks to ensure understanding, circulating to offer support and corrective feedback. Allow peer-to-peer discussion to build confidence before more public speaking.                     |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins| Students present their favorite game to small groups in a “mini-conference”. Allow groups to ask questions and provide feedback. Rotate roles to ensure all students have a chance to present and question. Maximize student speaking time by minimizing teacher intervention. Use formative assessment to observe and note areas of strength and those needing improvement, offering immediate praise or gentle correction as necessary.                         |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session where students share what they learned about each other's presentations. Highlight common errors and provide correction in a supportive manner. Use examples from the presentations to clarify misunderstandings. Wrap up with a group discussion on the role of teamwork and strategy in gaming. Use encouraging language to instill confidence and prepare students for future interactions.                                                |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins | Use this time for any additional questions or to extend on activities that need additional emphasis. Offer personalized feedback or target specific areas where students may have struggled. Inviting students to express their thoughts, questions, or remaining uncertainties can offer insights into their learning process, allowing you to adjust future lessons accordingly.                                                                                                   |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation strategies include offering varying complexity in graphic organizers and vocabulary sheets.
- Common pitfalls include misunderstanding slang or specific gaming terms; be ready to explain these thoroughly.
- Effective classroom management can be achieved by setting clear rules for discussions and maintaining an engaging pace throughout the lesson.
