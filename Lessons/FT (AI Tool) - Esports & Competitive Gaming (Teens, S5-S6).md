### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage | Timing | Detailed Activity Description & Instructions |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin the lesson by showing a short video clip from a popular esports competition. Ask students to discuss what they saw with a partner and list any games they recognized. Encourage students to share with the class. This initiation activity activates prior knowledge and builds interest. Utilize visual prompts and key questions to guide students toward the topic. Keep teacher talk minimal by using prompts like "What did you notice?" and "How did it make you feel?" to encourage student narration. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Facilitate a class discussion on their favorite games and if they've ever watched or played in a competitive setting. Use questions like "Have you ever participated in a gaming event?" and "What makes a game competitive?" Introduce the concept of esports and its cultural significance. Support understanding with images and descriptions of various games and events. Ensure comprehension with formative checks, like "Can someone explain what esports means?" Pair students to encourage dialogue, gradually releasing responsibility from teacher-led to student-led conversation. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Present models of language through reading excerpts or listening to clips where gamers discuss competition strategies. Students will have a task to note key vocabulary or strategies mentioned. Use guided examples to illustrate new vocabulary implicitly within the context of esports stories. Provide sentence starters and graphic organizers to support lower competency students and reinforce learning for all. Focus on student interaction by having them compare notes with a partner, furthering peer-to-peer learning. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | **Game-Based Activity:** Conduct a vocabulary bingo game where students listen for gaming terms during a dialogue. Explain the rules: as terms are mentioned, students mark them off their bingo card. Use visuals on the board to explain any unknown vocabulary. Enhancements such as optional sentence starters will prompt students to use these terms in sentences: "In esports, it's important to..." Have regular checks by pausing the activity to discuss the terms found. This fosters language accuracy and integrates formative assessment. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | In pairs, students plan a mini-presentation on their favorite esports game, focusing on strategies and cultural impact. Provide graphic organizers for structuring their speeches and ensure they include vocabulary from previous stages. Circulate while offering guidance, positive reinforcement, and focusing questions like "What makes this game interesting?" Ensure students are comfortable using language scaffolding like sentence starters to maintain accuracy and flow. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | **Game-Based Activity:** Students present their topics to the class in a "Game Show" format. After each presentation, peers can ask questions or provide commentary mimicking a game review panel. Encourage interaction by setting rules for questions or a comment framework, such as "Compare it with another game." This ensures engagement and authentic communication in a supportive, controlled setting. Moderately intervene to manage time and maintain focus on communicative tasks. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback based on students' presentations and interactions. Highlight the positives, such as effective vocabulary use and clear explanations. Address any common errors noticed during the presentation phase, using examples to model correct usage. Offer peer feedback opportunities, prompting students with "What did you learn from your peer’s presentation?" This process closes the loop on goals and reinforces learning paths. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)** | 5 mins | Use this time to revisit any unclear points, address additional questions, or engage in a final quick game-based activity if time allows, like a rapid-fire Q&A related to esports. This flexibility ensures that any emergent student needs or content misunderstandings are addressed promptly. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use varying difficulty levels in vocabulary games to cater to different proficiency levels within B1-B2. Provide additional resources for fast finishers.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students might focus on game details rather than language goals. Redirect focus back to language learning objectives if needed.
- **Classroom Management:** Use cooperative learning tactics to ensure all students participate equally. Rotate group roles to offer varied interaction opportunities.
