## Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins| To start, students will engage in a quick icebreaker called "Two Truths and a Lie" but with a problem-solving twist. Each student tells two real problem-solving situations and one fabricated one. The rest must guess the lie. This encourages student interaction and sets the tone for problem-solving. The teacher will pre-teach necessary vocabulary such as "analyze," "evaluate," and "solution." The activity promotes a supportive environment and builds rapport. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins| Begin by showing a short video clip of a common problem-solving scenario, like a team working together to plan an event. Pause the video at strategic points to ask students prediction questions, promoting active listening and critical thinking. Use visual aids to scaffold understanding and guide discussion around potential solutions. This anticipates language needs and primes learners for critical engagement with the material.                                              |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins| Create role-play scenarios where groups receive different problem situations to solve (e.g., lost in a city, planning a fundraiser). The teacher models language structures by enacting a problem-solving exchange. Students are given prompts on how to express their opinions and propose solutions, reinforced with sentence starters such as "In my opinion..." and "We could try...". This phase includes formative assessment through comprehension checks and peer interaction.            |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins| To reinforce key vocabulary and phrases, conduct an engaging quiz game using Kahoot. Students, in pairs, answer questions related to problem-solving language. The teacher monitors and provides immediate feedback. This competitive element, involving vocabulary like "evidence," "perspective," and "argument," solidifies understanding through repetition and contextual usage. Visual aids display words, definitions, and example sentences for extra support.                              |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins| Students work in small groups to prepare solutions for a given complex problem, such as reducing plastic waste at school. Provide graphic organizers to help outline their thoughts. Teachers circulate to offer guidance and formative feedback, bridging the gap between guided practice and independent problem-solving. Students use peer review frameworks to critique each other's preparation, ensuring understanding and collaboration.                                           |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins| Each group presents its problem and proposed solutions to the class. Encourage the use of smartboards for visual presentations. Implement a gallery walk, where groups rotate and discuss each other's solutions, promoting dynamic interaction. The teacher facilitates but allows students to lead the discussion, ensuring a student-centered environment. This activates spontaneous language use, builds confidence, and reinforces critical thinking skills.                                               |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session focusing on language use accuracy and effectiveness of arguments presented. Use a constructive approach by highlighting successful strategies and areas for improvement. The teacher writes common errors on the board anonymously, asking students to correct them collaboratively. This promotes self-reflection and peer learning, reinforcing the lesson’s language objectives.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins | Address any remaining questions or extend discussions on notable solutions. This time can also serve to address emergent language issues, providing personalized support to students needing further clarification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiate by providing word banks or additional sentence starters to students needing extra support.
- Monitor group dynamics, ensuring that all students participate and stay engaged.
- Be prepared to handle unexpected high-level solutions or emotional responses to real-world problems.
- Encourage peer correction during discussions to de-center teacher authority and promote autonomy.
