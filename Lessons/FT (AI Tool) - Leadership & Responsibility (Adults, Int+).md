### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                    | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description and Instructions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins    | Begin with a quick activity called "Leadership Charades." Students will work in small teams. Each team draws a card with leadership-related actions (e.g., delegating tasks, mediating a dispute) and acts it out while others guess. This energizing start sets a collaborative tone and familiarizes students with key concepts.               | Encourage all students to participate actively. Model enthusiasm and provide examples to ensure understanding. Clarify any difficult vocabulary during the activity.                                                                                                                                       |

| **Lead-In/Set Context**     | 10 mins    | Show a series of images depicting different leadership scenarios (e.g., a team meeting, a group solving a problem). Ask students to discuss in pairs what they observe and speculate on the role of the leader in each situation. Bring attention to cultural variations in leadership, linking to students’ experiences.                    | Use think-pair-share to minimize teacher talk. Prompt students with questions: "What do you think the leader's role is here?" "How does leadership vary across cultures?" Provide scaffolds like vocabulary prompts on the board.                                                                                                                              |

| **Present Model**            | 15 mins    | Present a short video clip demonstrating effective and ineffective leadership. Assign students the task of identifying leadership qualities and responsibilities shown. After viewing, facilitate a whole-class discussion on what made the leadership styles effective or not, utilizing a graphic organizer to note elements on the board.      | Activate student engagement with the video by setting clear expectations for note-taking. Scaffold with a graphic organizer to visualize the characteristics of effective leadership. Ensures students have a focus during the video.                                                                                                                                    |

| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins    | Conduct a game-based activity called "Leadership Bingo." Students use bingo cards filled with vocabulary related to leadership and responsibility. As you read out definitions or example sentences, students mark their cards. First to complete a row shouts "Bingo!" Review answers and provide further explanations as needed.            | Excellent opportunity for vocabulary revision. Offer sentence starters and ensure vocabulary cards are pre-taught for students who may struggle. Guide students through example sentences corresponding to each term to reinforce understanding.                                                                                                                            |

| **Preparation**              | 15 mins    | Divide students into small groups and distribute a scenario requiring leadership skills (e.g., handling a team conflict, delegating tasks for a project). In their groups, students discuss strategies and prepare a brief role-play demonstrating their solution. Monitor and provide language support, correcting or suggesting improvements. | Ensure groups are mixed to leverage peer support. Regularly check in to offer formative feedback and language support, using guided questions like “How would you resolve this?” Allocate roles within groups to ensure participation.                                                                                                                                       |

| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins    | Groups perform their role-plays for the class. While others watch, they note down effective language used and areas for improvement. After each performance, open the floor for feedback, encouraging positive reinforcement and constructive criticism. Use this as an opportunity to refine language through peer learning.                                 | Foster a supportive environment where students feel comfortable giving and receiving peer feedback. Provide sentence frames for providing comments, such as "I noticed that…" "Maybe you could try…" to ensure constructive dialogue. Reflect on key language notes after each enactment for reinforcement.                                                               |

| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Facilitate a whole-class feedback session, highlighting positive aspects of the performances and addressing common errors noted during the task. Use this as an opportunity to delve deeper into selected vocabulary or grammatical structures, offering additional examples and guided practice exercises for homework.                     | Balance between highlighting strengths and addressing areas for improvement. Correct errors but also encourage students to self-correct or peer-correct, promoting autonomous learning. Use formative assessment techniques, such as student reflection on what they’ve learned and what they think they could improve on.                    |

| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins     | Use this time to wrap up any unfinished discussions or queries, addressing any emergent needs, or extending the lesson into a short Q&A session about leadership and its challenges in various cultural or professional contexts.                                                                                                                                                   | Be flexible to student needs, potentially using this time for additional language practice or a brief reflective activity about the learning process. Use visual aids or quick prompts if engagement dips.                                                                                                                                          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Have additional vocabulary cards for advanced students or visuals for those needing extra support.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students understand conditionals, as these often cause confusion.
- **Classroom Management:** Use group rotations to ensure interaction with different peers, ensuring inclusivity in communication.
