### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                       | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins | Begin with a game of “Career Charades.” Students form small groups and take turns acting out different careers while their teammates guess. This activity not only serves to energize the class but also begins to introduce vocabulary around careers. Use visual aids and pre-teach essential language structures that students might use during the game, like “I think it’s…” or “Could it be…” to support them. Regular formative assessment questions like “Why do you think it’s this career?” will check comprehension and motivate peer support. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins | Conduct a group discussion on "What jobs interest you for the future?" Use prompts and images to help students brainstorm. This segment activates prior knowledge and sets the context for the lesson's topic. Allow students to discuss in pairs, gradually building towards sharing with the whole class. Integrate a graphic organizer where students can jot down their ideas, enhancing their ability to contribute to the full discussion. Think-Pair-Share technique ensures everyone participates, gradually releasing responsibility from the teacher to the students. |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins | Introduce a short video or audio clip featuring a professional discussing their career path and workplace. Students have a task to note down key skills mentioned. Conduct a short comprehension check after the clip by having students share their notes within their groups. By presenting an authentic context, students get to see the target language in use. Model note-taking strategies before the activity starts, and use peer collaboration to reinforce learning. Check for understanding by asking specific questions about the clip using sentence starters on the board: "The speaker mentioned that..." |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins | Play “Skill Bingo,” where students have bingo cards with key career skills and future trends. As the teacher calls out descriptions, students mark off matching terms on their cards. The first to complete a line wins. This game reinforces vocabulary and encourages fast recall. Provide a vocabulary handout beforehand with definitions and sample sentences. During the game, circulate and assist students, especially with pronunciation and understanding of complex terms. The handout acts as a reference throughout the activity, scaffolding the language acquisition process. |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins | Organize students into groups to prepare for a role-play on job interviews. Each group draws a situation card with a different job and has to prepare a short role-play using the target vocabulary and structures. Encourage students to use graphic organizers to plan their dialogues, focusing on workplace scenarios. This practice allows for creative and structured preparation, ensuring the accuracy of language use. Tasking students with creating open-ended questions for the interviews encourages deeper thinking and enhances peer collaboration. |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins | Students perform their role-plays. The audience takes notes on key skills and future plans mentioned. After each role-play, conduct peer feedback sessions where students compliment two aspects and suggest one area of improvement. This enhances language fluency through authentic communication and self-reflection. Teacher circulates to provide support and conduct formative checks on their performance, focusing more on student interactivity. Highlight unique sentence structures used during role-plays on the board for everyone’s benefit. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conduct a class feedback session, highlighting commonly used strengths and correcting recurring errors noted during role-plays. Use examples from student performances, written on the board, to offer clear correction points. Encourage self and peer-correction through guided questions, such as "What could be a better way to say…?". Emphasize positive reinforcement and share strategies for improvement. Wrap up the session by revisiting any difficult vocabulary or structures to ensure clarity and retention. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Adjust the complexity of role-play scenarios based on student proficiency levels. Provide extra support or pair stronger students with weaker ones as needed.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with future tense variations. Remind them to use sentence starters and offer visual cues to reinforce learning.
- **Classroom Management:** Monitor groups closely during pair and group activities, gently guiding off-track discussions back to the topic. Maintain a 20:80 teacher-to-student talk ratio by initiating group discussions and encouraging peer feedback.
