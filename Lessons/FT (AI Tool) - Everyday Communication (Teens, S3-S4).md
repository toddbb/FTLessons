|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins    | Begin with a fun interactive game like "Two Truths and a Lie" to establish rapport and create a comfortable environment. Students work in small groups, sharing two facts and one lie about themselves. Peers guess which statement is the lie. This encourages students to speak immediately and engage with one another. The focus is on relaxed and informal interaction, serving as an icebreaker to foster a supportive classroom atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                            | Encourage participation by demonstrating the activity with personal examples. Allow creativity and humor to facilitate comfort.                                               |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins    | Continue with a context-setting activity involving authentic visuals and scenarios. Display images of everyday situations (e.g., in a café, at the park). Ask students to describe what they see and predict the conversation topics. This taps into prior knowledge, helps conceptualize the topic, and creates a visual anchor for the lesson. This activity broadens context and ignites interest. Students then share in pairs what they commonly discuss in these situations.                                                                                                                                         | Use open-ended questions to stimulate discussion. Encourage students to make connections with their personal experiences. Ensure images are culturally diverse.            |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins    | Present a model dialogue through a short skit presented by two teachers or through a video. The dialogue will include greetings, asking and answering about one's day, and a simple exchange of pleasantries. Provide a transcript of the dialogue for students to follow along. Encourage students to listen for key phrases and intonation. After viewing, conduct a quick comprehension check with questions like: “What did they talk about?" or “How did they greet each other?” This ensures students understand the dialogue content and its everyday application.                                    | Model the dialogue expressing enthusiasm and clear pronunciation. Emphasize the natural flow of exchanges. Provide cultural notes if necessary (e.g., expressions of politeness). |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins    | Organize a vocabulary and phrase-matching game. Provide students with laminated cards, each with a word or phrase on one and the corresponding definition or use on another. Spread the cards across tables and allow students to roam and match them as quickly as they can. This game-like format reinforces vocabulary retention through kinetic learning and peer collaboration. Post-game, elicit the phrases and sentences they formed, focusing on pronunciation and application. Encourage repetition to aid retention and ensure comprehension.                                                              | Encourage students to work in pairs to promote peer teaching. Use pronunciation drills for difficult words. Allow students to self-correct if possible.                  |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins    | In groups, students prepare short role-plays related to everyday situations, using cue cards provided. Situations might include ordering food, asking for directions, or greeting a friend. This activity allows students to organize thoughts, choose appropriate vocabulary, and practice sentence construction. Each group selects a scenario and writes a short dialogue, ensuring all group members have a speaking part. The focus is on structuring their interactions with newly learned phrases, balanced between fluency and accuracy, with peer feedback provided as they rehearse.                           | Circulate to assist groups, ensuring all students participate. Provide scaffolding with sentence starters or prompts as needed. Give formative feedback during preparation.|
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins    | Groups perform their role-plays in front of the class. Encourage creativity by allowing students to incorporate props or gestures. After each performance, offer positive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Engage the audience with a task during performances, such as listing useful phrases or predicting what happens next in the scenarios. This helps maintain student attention and reinforces language acquisition through active participation. End the task with a group reflection on the activity's challenges and learnings, encouraging metacognitive awareness and collaboration.                | Maintain a supportive environment, highlighting positive aspects of each performance. Use peer assessments to encourage constructive feedback. Facilitate a safe space for errors and learning. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Conduct a group feedback session focusing on common errors observed during role-plays. Praise strengths and address language issues such as tense consistency or pronunciation challenges. Utilize examples from student performances to correct errors collectively. Employ error correction techniques like echoing, reformulation, and clarification requests. End with a quick quiz game where students correct sentences. This interactive wrap-up reinforces learnings and strengthens the community in expressing, understanding, and applying feedback constructively. | Balance feedback with encouragement. Use examples from performances to relate directly to students' experiences. Foster a dialogic approach, inviting student input for corrections. |
