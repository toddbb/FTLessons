|------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Begin with an icebreaker game called "The Persuader". In this activity, students work in pairs. One student is given a random object, and their task is to persuade their partner why it is essential for a hypothetical scenario (e.g., "Why a rubber duck is necessary for a business meeting"). This creates a fun and dynamic atmosphere, warming students up to the topic of persuasion. Encourage laughter and creativity, which facilitates a relaxed environment supporting language risk-taking. During the exercise, provide guiding questions on the board to stimulate ideas (e.g., What makes this object special?).                                                                                    | Encourage creativity and humor. Allow students to choose scenarios that interest them for better engagement.                                             |

| Lead-In / Set Context         | 10 mins | Transition into discussing real-life situations requiring negotiation and persuasion (e.g., buying a car, negotiating rent, convincing a friend to try a new activity). Use open-ended questions to elicit students' previous experiences in negotiation. Create a mind map on the board with key ideas and vocabulary that students mention, targeting specific negotiation-related terms. This visual aid helps students connect new knowledge to prior experiences, making learning more relevant. Ensure students understand that this lesson applies to both professional and personal contexts, highlighting its versatility and importance.                                 | Use students' examples to build interest and motivation. Ensure varied scenarios to address diverse contexts.                                              |

| Present Model                 | 15 mins | Present two contrasting video clips of negotiation scenarios, one poorly executed and one successful. Assign listening tasks focusing on identifying effective language and strategies used in successful negotiations. Follow this with peer discussions to break down differences between the clips, stimulating critical thinking. This analysis is scaffolded by using guided questions (e.g., How did tone impact the outcome? What words stuck out?). This methodology leverages Vygotsky's social development theory, where students learn through interaction, ensuring they can identify negotiation techniques independently. Document observations on the board.                            | Choose clips that are culturally relevant and engaging. Highlight language differences visually on the board for clarity.                                    |

| Useful Language               | 15 mins | Introduce focus vocabulary and phrases typical in negotiation contexts through the "Negotiation Bingo" game. Prepare Bingo cards with key negotiation phrases (e.g., "Can we find a compromise?", "I propose...", "Would you consider..."). Students listen carefully during a simulated negotiation where these phrases are modeled. When they hear a phrase, they mark it off their card. This game-based approach keeps the activity interactive and increases engagement. Post-activity, allow groups to review and discuss the phrases, fostering peer learning and reinforcing the language's real-world applications.                                                         | Clarify complex phrases with synonyms or examples. Ensure varied repetition of phrases to aid recognition and retention.                                    |

| Preparation                   | 15 mins | Students work in pairs to plan a negotiation role-play. Reference authentic scenarios related to their personal interests (e.g., salary negotiation, proposing a team project). Provide a graphic organizer to outline roles, objectives, and persuasive strategies. Scaffold this preparation with sentence starters and example negotiations. Guide students through step-by-step modeling of crafting arguments and persuasive statements. This preparation phase encourages organized thinking and linguistic creativity, fostering readiness for the subsequent interactive task while respecting the gradual release of responsibility teaching model.                                         | Provide supportive and specific feedback during preparation to boost confidence and clarify expectations.                                                 |

| Complete Task                 | 35 mins | Pairs conduct their negotiations while being recorded for later analysis. Emphasize the focus on fluency and persuasive strategy rather than perfect grammar. The task is dynamic and requires negotiating a resolution to a posed problem. During their exchanges, circulate and take notes on language use and strategies for the final feedback session. The real-time negotiation simulates authentic language use, challenging students to adaptively employ taught strategies. Post-session, students self-assess using their recordings to reflect on language use, encouraging self-correction and deeper understanding through metacognitive processes.                                                         | Ensure the focus remains on communication effectiveness over grammatical precision, guiding with formative feedback rather than immediate corrections.        |

| Feedback/Error Correction     | 15 mins | Conclude with constructive feedback focusing on language use, strategy effectiveness, and overall communication impact. Use recorded examples to highlight successful strategies and provide constructive criticism. Group feedback fosters a community of learning, with shared successes and challenges. Tailor commentary to include both immediate corrective feedback and suggestions for continued improvement. Provide visual feedback on the board, re-documenting effective phrases and strategies discussed. This reflective stage is crucial in solidifying skills learned and motivating students towards using their new skills in real-world scenarios.                                    | Encourage students to share their experiences and insights, promoting a collaborative learning environment. Focus on strengths alongside areas for improvement. |

| Flex-time/Buffer              | 5 mins  | Use this time to address any unanticipated questions or provide additional practice on areas students found challenging. You can also use this time to delve deeper into any topic students express particular interest in. This flexibility ensures the lesson remains student-centered and responsive to emergent needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Be responsive and adaptive to students' needs and interests. Provide additional resources or support as necessary to justify pedagogically any unexpected challenges. |
