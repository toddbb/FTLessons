| Warmer                      | 10 mins| Start by showing a series of flashcards depicting people from different cultures around the world. Engage students in a game-like activity called “Guess the Culture.” Each student takes turns guessing the country and culture associated with the image. Encourage students to use phrases like, "I think this is..." or "This looks like...". After a guess, provide immediate feedback and share a fun fact about the culture. This warmer sets a positive and energetic tone as students begin to think about multiculturalism.| Encourage guesses and prompt students gently if they need help. Use this opportunity to activate prior knowledge and make cultural connections.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Lead-In / Set Context       | 10 mins| Introduce a short video clip that describes life in a multicultural city. Before playing, ask students to note down any interesting elements or challenges they observe. Pair students to discuss their observations and share aloud with the class. Use this discussion to set the context for the day's lesson on multicultural awareness and diversity. The lead-in will help students connect with personal and global experiences regarding multicultural environments.                                           | Prompt students to notice both visual and audio cues that illustrate multicultural interactions. Use questions like, "What caught your attention?" or "What seemed interesting/unusual to you?"                                                                                                      |
| Present Model               | 15 mins| Present a structured model conversation about multicultural experiences between two people. Display the conversation on the screen. Students listen first, and then read along during a second playback. Ask them to focus on the use of target vocabulary and expressions. After listening, highlight important phrases and vocabulary. Then, role-play the conversation in pairs using sentence starters. This student-centered approach ensures engagement and careful observation of language use.            | Guide students towards expressions showing opinions or experiences. Provide sentence starters like, "In my country...", "I feel that multiculturalism means...", and pair students strategically to foster drop-in support.                                                                        |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins| Conduct an interactive game using the Kahoot platform, focusing on matching vocabulary such as "multiculturalism," "diversity," "culture,” etc., with their definitions. After each question, reiterate critical points to further consolidate meaning. Prior to playing, pre-teach vocabulary and ensure understanding via flashcards. Ensure students understand the pronunciation of each word using IPA. This playful competition increases engagement while reinforcing understanding of essential vocabulary. | Give clear instructions on how to use Kahoot. Provide verbal and visual reinforcement for each word. Use pronunciation drills for difficult words, and encourage students' enthusiasm during the game.                                                                                                 |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins| In pairs, students brainstorm ideas for a short presentation on the benefits and challenges of multicultural environments. They use a graphic organizer to jot down ideas under headings like "Benefits" and "Challenges". Model how to use the organizer to enhance structure. Prompt peer discussion as students refine their notes, promoting collaboration and sharing of insights. This structured planning time will ensure students feel prepared and confident in delivering their presentations.                  | Offer guidance on using graphic organizers effectively. Circulate the room to offer advice and encourage collaboration. Scaffold their discussions with questions like, "What are some benefits of multicultural environments?"                                                                        |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins| Students take turns delivering their prepared presentations to small groups. Encourage them to use new vocabulary and provide sentence starters to support fluency. Each presentation is followed by a Q&A session, encouraging attentive listening and creating opportunities for authentic interaction. As students present, peer group members take notes on key points to facilitate feedback. This task focuses on building fluency and evolving confidence in communicating about multicultural topics.                     | Offer affirmation and constructive feedback. Monitor for use of new vocabulary and model clear, respectful structures for Q&A segments. This balances fluency with comprehension, engaging students in discussion.                                                                                        |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins| After all presentations, hold a feedback session. Start with a peer-feedback round supported by a checklist provided in each group's materials. Follow up with teacher feedback focusing on pragmatics, vocabulary use, and grammar. Balance correction with positive reinforcement, addressing any common errors noted during presentations. End with a reflective question encouraging self-assessment: "How did speaking about multiculturalism feel?" This helps reinforce the learning while preparing students for independent use. | Frame feedback positively and encourage peer recognition of strengths. Utilize a checklist to guide feedback and provide models for correcting errors respectfully, maintaining a supportive atmosphere.                                                                                                   |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins | Use any remaining time for students to ask questions or add comments about the session. Alternatively, play a quick closing game revisiting vocabulary in an engaging way. This serves to wrap up the lesson on a positive note, ensuring any unforeseen needs are addressed.                                                                                                                             | Keep the closing time flexible, adapting quickly to the needs and energy of the class. Play a vocabulary memory game or offer time for open-ended questions.                                                                                                                                        |
