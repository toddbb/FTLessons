| Stage | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with a quick interactive quiz using Kahoot, focusing on fun facts about popular social media platforms. This engages students and refreshes prior knowledge. Divide the class into small groups to discuss their favorite social media platform and the reasons they use it. Encourage sharing of personal anecdotes to build rapport and create positive energy. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a short, engaging video clip highlighting the evolution of social media trends over the past decade. Follow with a whole-class discussion on initial thoughts and feelings about these trends. Pre-teach essential vocabulary using visual aids and sentence starters. Ask students guided questions to activate prior knowledge and prepare them for deeper exploration of the topic. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Present authentic examples of influencer posts or viral content. Use this as a model for discussing language and trends. Provide students with a task to identify specific vocabulary and grammatical structures within these examples. Model how to express opinions about the content, highlighting sentence structure and intonation. Use peer support frameworks by pairing students to compare their observations. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Conduct a card-matching game where students match social media vocabulary with definitions. This game-based activity increases engagement and retention. Provide graphic organizers for students to categorize terms (e.g., platforms, actions, people). Use regular formative assessment checkpoints with quick questions to ensure comprehension. Scaffold learning with sentence starters for forming opinions. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | In pairs, students plan a two-minute presentation on a trending topic or influencer of their choice. Provide a graphic organizer to outline their points, ensuring a balanced focus on accuracy and fluency. Walk around and offer feedback to guide students in refining their language and presentation skills. Encourage independence by releasing more responsibility for content generation to students. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Students deliver their presentations to small groups. Encourage authentic interaction by asking the listeners to pose questions or give feedback. Rotate groups to maximize interaction with different peers. This task creates a dynamic environment that mirrors real-world social media discussions. Conduct comprehension checks through peer questions and prompts. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback on language use and presentation delivery. Highlight strengths and suggest areas for improvement, focusing on pronunciation, vocabulary choice, and grammatical accuracy. Use positive reinforcement and model corrected sentences. Allow students to self-assess and offer peer feedback to reinforce learning. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer** | Optional 5 mins | Use this time to address any emergent questions or clarify doubts. This provides additional support and reinforces learning for students needing more guidance. |

#### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide additional sentence starters for students needing extra support. Offer advanced students more complex structures or tasks involving deeper cultural analysis.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Be cautious of overloading students with too much vocabulary at once. Introduce language gradually with frequent checks for understanding.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage a collaborative atmosphere by managing group rotations smoothly and monitoring group interactions to ensure equal participation.
