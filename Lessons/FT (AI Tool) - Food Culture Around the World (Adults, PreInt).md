### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                       | Timing  | Detailed Activity Description |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins | Begin with a quick game of "Food Bingo" to introduce the topic of food culture in an engaging way. Each student receives a bingo card with different types of food from around the world, such as sushi, tacos, and pasta. As each food item is called out, students mark it on their card if they have it. The first to get a line shouts "Bingo!" This activity activates prior knowledge and sets a lively tone. Scaffold vocabulary by introducing items visually through a projector. Check comprehension with CCQs (e.g., "What is sushi? Where is it from?"). Encourage peer interaction to facilitate comfort and rapport building. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins | Show a short video featuring street food from various countries. Students watch for three main types of food per country featured. Afterward, conduct a brief discussion to elicit students' initial reactions and thoughts. Use open-ended questions like "What foods looked new or unusual to you?" and "How is street food significant in different cultures?" Provide sentence starters and visual aids to help organize their thoughts. Encourage partner sharing before whole-class feedback to ensure broad participation. |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins | Introduce a dialogue between two friends discussing their favorite food cultures using a scripted audio clip. Provide students with a gap-fill exercise that requires careful listening to complete. Students listen twice: first to grasp the general idea, and second to fill in the gaps. Discuss the completed dialogue as a class, highlighting key vocabulary and phrases. Scaffold understanding with definitions and examples on the board. Perform comprehension checks with specific questions about the dialogue's content and vocabulary to ensure clarity. |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins | A game-based activity called "Culinary Charades" follows. Split students into pairs and give each pair a set of flashcards featuring food-related vocabulary. One student acts out the term without speaking, while the other guesses. This helps reinforce vocabulary and encourages lively interaction and laughter. Provide a list of vocabulary with definitions, IPA pronunciation, and example sentences for support. Rotate roles after each turn to give equal practice opportunity. Use peer feedback to correct errors and enhance accuracy. |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins | In small groups, students prepare a short presentation on a specific country's food culture, using a graphic organizer to plan their points (e.g., traditional dishes, cultural significance, special ingredients). Provide a model presentation outline and sentence starters to guide structure. Encourage students to use at least five new vocabulary words from the lesson. Offer teacher support as they organize their ideas, ensuring all group members contribute. This phase is crucial for rehearsing and organizing language before speaking independently. |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins | Students deliver their presentations in groups, presenting to the class. Use a "gallery walk" format where groups rotate every few minutes to different stations. At each station, an assigned student presents while others listen, ask questions, and provide peer feedback using a checklist. Rotate presenters within groups for exposure and practice. This format ensures high engagement, with each student practicing both speaking and listening skills. Teacher circulates for real-time feedback and note-taking for later correction. Allocate time for Q&A after each presentation rotation to stimulate discussion and enhance interaction. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conclude the lesson with a feedback session. Use notes taken during presentations to highlight excellent language use and correct recurring errors. Provide constructive feedback that focuses on both fluency and accuracy. Use examples from students’ presentations to clarify misconceptions. Encourage peer feedback where appropriate to foster collaborative learning. Conclude with positive affirmations, highlighting the progress made throughout the lesson. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins  | Address any questions or revisit challenging concepts. Provide additional support or clarification to ensure understanding. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide extra visual aids and simplified texts for students who need more support. Encourage advanced students to incorporate more complex structures in their presentations.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure time management is maintained during activities to allow equal opportunity for all students. Use timer apps to keep transitions smooth.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for over-reliance on familiar vocabulary during presentations. Encourage the use of various words and phrases introduced in the lesson.
