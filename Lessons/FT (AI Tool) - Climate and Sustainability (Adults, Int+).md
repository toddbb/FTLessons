| **Stage**                 | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins    | Begin the lesson by showing a short, engaging video clip introducing key concepts of climate change. Ask students to share one surprising fact they learned or already knew about the topic. This relaxed turn-taking will help students to feel comfortable while discussing familiar or new concepts regarding climate change later. Use this opportunity to introduce the target vocabulary naturally within context through questions and light discussion. | Encourage as much student interaction as possible. Emphasize comfort and openness, reducing teacher talk through open-ended questions.                                                                                                        |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins    | Display an infographic on the board illustrating individual carbon footprints. Ask students to analyze the graphic in pairs and discuss in which areas people can make the most significant impact. Use guiding questions to facilitate discussion: "What surprised you about carbon footprints? How does this relate to sustainability?" Monitor conversations, offering vocabulary assistance and supporting peer exchange, utilizing the infographic as a visual scaffold.  | Ensure students use complete sentences. Guide them with visual aids, questions, or vocabulary prompts. Encourage mutual exchange, allowing peers to clarify or build on each other’s ideas.                                                        |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins    | Play a second video clip demonstrating a clear model discussion on sustainability practices. Students should identify and note down useful vocabulary and expressions used. Follow up by dividing the class into small groups to discuss the same topic using the notes taken. Provide sentence starters and encourage accurate replication of the models presented in the video to support language structure recall and application during group discussions.                       | Use the video as a formative assessment by observing students’ comprehension and identifying areas needing clarification. Allow the students to ask questions for better understanding before moving onto productions.                           |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins    | Implement a vocabulary Bingo game using key words like "renewable energy", "conservation", and "recycle." Each student receives a bingo card with key terms. The teacher will call out definitions, and students must match the definition with the term on their card. As terms are called, encourage students to form sentences with the terms when they get Bingo, reinforcing meaning and usage in context. This game-based activity supports memorization and practical application of new terminology. | Ensure clarity in the definitions given and provide immediate feedback. Encourage students to ask about uncertain words, thereby enhancing vocabulary confidence through play.                                                                    |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins    | Distribute role-play cards, each featuring a sustainability-related scenario. Group students by theme (e.g., household sustainability, corporate responsibility). Allow time for groups to plan a brief role-play demonstrating their scenario, incorporating target language. Provide sentence starters and offer guidance during this preparation phase, supporting accurate and creative usage of vocabulary and expressions learned throughout the lesson.                                   | Walk around to assess their brainstorming, giving feedback and additional suggestions where needed. Encourage students to incorporate language models provided earlier and collaborate to build productive scenarios.                           |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins    | Facilitate role-play presentations where each group acts out their scenario. Ensure active engagement by assigning other groups to take notes and ask questions or give constructive feedback after each presentation. Encourage the use of learned expressions, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. This allows for spontaneous and authentic language use, challenging students to think on their feet and apply learned language creatively in real-time discussions.                      | Monitor language use, taking notes on fluency and accuracy for later feedback. Encourage peer assessment and appreciation of both performance and content. Emphasize strengths in communication and provide corrective feedback sensitively.         |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | After all role-plays, offer constructive feedback addressing common errors noted during tasks. Focus on pronunciation, vocabulary usage, and grammatical accuracy, highlighting successful language strategies noticed during role plays. Facilitate a group discussion where students reflect on their performances and share what they've learned or found challenging. Conclude with encouragements and specific suggestions for further improvement in discussing environmental topics.                       | Use concrete examples from students’ language productions for correction. Encourage self-assessment and reflection through open discussion, guiding students towards an awareness of personal strengths and areas for future improvement.            |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**      | 5 mins     | Allocate this time to cover emergent questions or revisit areas of difficulty. Consider reviewing any vocabulary or expressions that were challenging to use during activities or answering specific questions students may have about the lesson content. This flex time ensures all students leave the lesson with a stronger understanding and confidence in discussing climate and sustainability topics.                                                                                | Maintain a supportive atmosphere where students feel comfortable voicing uncertainties or seeking clarification without judgement. Aim to clarify with examples or additional explanations.                                                        |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Employ differentiation strategies by adjusting the complexity of role-play cards to match varying language proficiencies within B1-B2.
- Monitor group dynamics to ensure equal participation.
- Encourage students to personalize examples, relating sustainability to their own experiences.
