| Stage                         | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Instruction Tips                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins| Begin the lesson with a fun icebreaker game called "Two Truths and a Lie". Each student writes down two true statements and one false statement about themselves. Students take turns sharing, and classmates guess which statement is false. This creates a relaxed atmosphere and encourages speaking. | Encourage students to be creative and provide them with examples. Model the game by sharing your own two truths and a lie. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins| Show a short video clip of a job interview. Pause the video at key moments to discuss what makes good self-presentation. Ask students to share their observations and any experiences they have with interviews. This activates prior knowledge and sets the context for the lesson. | Use visual aids and vocabulary lists to support understanding. Ask open-ended questions to prompt discussion.               |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins| Introduce model self-introductions and interview answers. Provide sample dialogues and have students listen. Use guided examples and explicit teacher modeling to highlight key language structures. Students work in pairs to practice these models, using sentence starters and visual aids. | Use choral repetition to practice pronunciation. Check understanding with comprehension questions.                          |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins| Play a vocabulary bingo game using key interview phrases and vocabulary. Provide students with bingo cards filled with relevant words. Call out definitions, and students must match them to the correct word. This game reinforces vocabulary in a fun and engaging way.                                     | Use clear definitions and example sentences. Encourage peer support and pair students for collaborative play.               |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins| Students plan their own self-introduction and answers to common interview questions. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their ideas. Encourage students to include interesting facts about themselves and use new vocabulary. Facilitate peer collaboration for idea sharing.                          | Monitor and provide feedback during planning. Offer sentence starters and prompts for students needing additional support.  |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins| Conduct a role-play activity where students simulate interviews in pairs. One student acts as the interviewer, the other as the interviewee. Rotate roles, allowing both practice. Encourage recording the interviews for later analysis if possible. Promote spontaneous and genuine interaction.                   | Provide constructive feedback and highlight strengths. Use formative assessment checkpoints to gauge progress.                |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conclude with a feedback session. Allow students to share their experiences and reflect on their performances. Encourage peer feedback and focus on positive language use. Conduct corrective feedback sessions emphasizing pronunciation, grammar, and effective self-presentation skills.                             | Focus on specific errors and provide strategies for improvement. Celebrate successes and encourage continuous practice.      |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins | Use as needed to address any emerging needs, questions, or to review key vocabulary if time permits.                                                                                                                                                                      | Be adaptable and responsive to students' needs. Encourage questions and further practice if necessary.                      |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Use differentiation strategies by providing additional support materials for students with lower proficiency.
- Monitor pair activities closely, ensuring equitable participation.
- Use classroom management techniques to maintain engagement during role-play activities.
