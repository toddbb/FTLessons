|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 min | Begin with a quick introductory round where each student shares one fantastic team experience they've had. Encourage expressions of emotion and use open-ended questions to facilitate a deeper conversation. This allows students to practice fluency in a low-pressure setting as they get to know each other. | Prompt shy students with specific questions to help them open up. Model how to expand on simple statements.                                                   |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 min | Introduce the topic of teamwork through a brief video clip demonstrating a collaborative team effort in a project setting. After watching, students discuss in pairs what they observed about team dynamics and effective communication. Use guiding questions to focus their observations.                                                           | Use visual aids to support comprehension. Pre-teach any challenging vocabulary from the clip using pictures or examples.                                       |
| **Present Model**           | 15 min | Present different expressions and phrases used in teamwork contexts. Provide a short dialogue showcasing these phrases in action. Use role-play to model how to suggest ideas and negotiate tasks. Students should listen and note down useful phrases. Follow up with guided questions to ensure understanding.                                         | Use role-play to engage students actively. Provide sentence starters and visual aids to support listening and comprehension.                                    |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 min | Conduct a collaborative word building game where students form pairs and create as many teamwork-related phrases as possible using word cards. Integrate time limits to encourage speed and cooperation. The aim is to reinforce vocabulary recall and application in a dynamic setting.                                                       | Switch pairs to foster new interactions. Offer examples and prompt use of L2 through scaffolding. Check for comprehension while circulating.                  |
| **Preparation**             | 15 min | Organize students into small groups and assign each group a different teamwork scenario (e.g., planning a charity event, solving a logistical issue). Each group discusses and plans their approach using the language structures learned. Students create a mind map to organize their collaborative ideas.                                        | Monitor and provide hints or exemplar language if students struggle. Use prompt cards to guide discussions.                                                    |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 min | Each group presents their teamwork plan to the class. Encourage the use of target language and teamwork vocabulary. Other groups listen actively and ask follow-up questions, allowing presenters to defend or clarify their strategies. This fosters a collaborative learning environment and practices spontaneous interactions.                                  | Ensure equal participation by setting turn-taking rules. Provide feedback on language use and strategies. Encourage respectful and constructive interactions.  |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 min | Provide feedback focusing on language accuracy and teamwork strategies. Highlight effective communication strategies and correct any persistent errors. Reinforce key phrases and address common pitfalls observed during presentations. Use examples from student presentations to illustrate points.                                                                                           | Frame feedback positively to encourage improvement. Offer strategies for self-correction and peer support. Include time for student reflection on performance. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation**: Group students of mixed abilities to balance skills.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Students may revert to L1 when negotiating. Encourage persistence in L2 through supportive prompts.
- **Classroom Management**: Use visual timers to manage stages and ensure smooth transitions.
