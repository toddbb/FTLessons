### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                | Instruction Tips                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins| Begin with a game of "Travel Charades" where students act out different travel-related scenarios such as "boarding a plane" or "taking a taxi." Students guess each other's actions, promoting spontaneous language use. This game will help create a relaxed environment and activate prior knowledge about travel experiences. | Encourage creativity and quick thinking. Use gestures and props to model how to participate effectively.            |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins| Introduce the theme "Travel & Adventure" by showing pictures of various travel destinations and asking students to share places they want to visit and why. Encourage them to use descriptive language. Conduct a brief whole-class discussion about personal travel experiences to set the context. | Ask guiding questions to spark curiosity and make connections to personal experiences.                            |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins| Play an audio clip of a dialogue between a traveler and a hotel receptionist. Students listen for key phrases used in making a hotel reservation. After listening, students discuss with a partner what they heard and share with the class. Teacher highlights useful expressions on the board. | Use visual aids like pictures of hotel features to help students visualize the dialogue content. Provide transcripts for support. |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins| Organize a "Vocabulary Bingo" game using essential travel vocabulary. Students receive bingo cards with words related to travel, such as "passport," "suitcase," "airport," etc. As the teacher calls out definitions or shows pictures, students mark the corresponding word. The first to complete a row shouts "Bingo!" and shares their list with the class. | Ensure that the vocabulary aligns with the key language required. Use flashcards and visual aids to reinforce understanding. |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins| In pairs, students receive a travel scenario card, such as booking a tour or asking for directions. They plan a short role-play using a graphic organizer that prompts them to include specific details like questions to ask or information to provide. Teacher circulates to offer guidance and support. | Provide sentence starters and model dialogues as examples. Encourage peer feedback and revisions.                   |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins| Students conduct their role-plays in front of the class, acting out their assigned travel scenarios. Encourage them to use newly learned vocabulary and focus on clear pronunciation. After each performance, peers provide positive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Ensure all students are engaged and participating. | Create a supportive environment. Provide a checklist to help students assess peers constructively.                  |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| Conduct a group discussion on common language errors observed during role-plays. Highlight key areas for improvement, offering correct examples and explanations. Encourage students to reflect on their performances and set goals for future practice. | Use specific examples from the role-plays to illustrate points. Offer praise alongside constructive feedback to motivate students. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins | Allow any remaining time for students to ask questions, revisit complex vocabularies, or share personal travel stories. This time can be used to consolidate learning or clarify misunderstandings. | Stay flexible and responsive to students' needs. Encourage questions and facilitate additional practice if needed.  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies**: Pair stronger students with those needing support during role-plays. Provide additional vocabulary for advanced learners.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Watch for students reverting to their first language due to vocabulary gaps; reteach key terms as necessary.
- **Classroom Management**: Ensure activities run within time and keep track of group dynamics to maintain engagement.
