### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage** | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description** | **Instruction Tips** |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Warmer | 10 mins | Start with a "Guess the Food" game. Display pictures of iconic foods from various cultures (e.g., sushi, tacos, pizza) and ask students to guess their names and origins. Use an interactive digital platform to allow students to vote. Scaffold by modeling pronunciation and providing clues. This activity helps activate students' existing knowledge while engaging them visually and interactively. Ensure to check comprehension through quick, informal questioning. | Use visuals as clues; encourage guessing. Model words clearly. Engage all students through participation. |
| Lead-In / Set Context | 10 mins | Introduce the topic of global food culture by showing a short video clip showcasing diverse culinary practices around the globe. Follow up with open-ended questions to the class about their favorite food and any international dishes they have tried. Use think-pair-share activity, letting students discuss in pairs before sharing with the class. Encourage them to use the target vocabulary and provide them with sentence starters like "I like to eat...because...". This helps in setting the context and stimulates interest. | Prompt students to relate personally. Use a graphic organizer to list down foods and their countries. |
| Present Model | 15 mins | Present a model conversation between two people talking about different food cultures. Provide a transcript on the handout and play the dialogue. Students listen to identify key vocabulary and structures. Involve students by having them underline new vocabulary and expressions in the transcript. Utilize a matching exercise where students pair food items with countries. Conduct comprehension checks by asking specific questions about the dialogue. This stage promotes active listening and comprehension. | Highlight key phrases in the script. Use visual aids to connect vocabulary with images. |
| Useful Language | 15 mins | Through a game-based activity like "Food Culture Bingo", students practice vocabulary in context. Create bingo cards with words related to world cuisines. As you state different dishes and food practices, students mark their cards. Encourage them to say the name and the culture it originates from when they achieve Bingo. This activity reinforces vocabulary and encourages interaction. Assess understanding by listening to student responses. Support weaker students by pairing them with stronger peers. | Engage students by raising excitement levels. Encourage using full sentences when describing. |
| Preparation | 15 mins | Organize students into small groups. Each group picks a culture's food to research. Provide them with graphic organizers to jot down notes on the food’s ingredients, significance, and how it is eaten. Prompt them with questions like “What makes this food special?” “When is it usually eaten?”. Allow them to plan a brief presentation, guiding them to structure their findings logically. Use check-in points as you move around to address questions and ensure clarity. | Provide examples to inspire ideas. Offer sentence starters to ease presentation creation. |
| Complete Task | 35 mins | Groups present their chosen food culture to the class. Encourage the audience to ask questions or share related experiences. Facilitate a role-play where some students act as chefs or cultural ambassadors explaining their dishes to potential tourists (classmates). This interactive session enhances speaking skills by allowing students to practice in simulated real-life communications. Promote feedback by guiding students to offer constructive comments. | Encourage active listening. Facilitate peer feedback by offering set phrases students can use. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | After presentations, provide balanced feedback. Highlight both strengths (e.g., creative descriptions, use of vocabulary) and areas to improve (e.g., pronunciation issues). Use positive reinforcement and offer clarification where needed. Conduct a whole group correction session for common mistakes noted during presentations. This supports learning by reinforcing correct usage and addressing language gaps. | Use examples from student work. Recast incorrect sentences correctly. Ensure feedback is supportive and motivating. |
| Flex-time/Buffer | 5 mins | Address any final questions and provide a quick summary of the lesson's key points. Encourage students to share something new they’ve learned about a different culture’s food. This can be done as a quick round where each student contributes a thought. It ensures any uncertainties are dealt with and consolidates learning. | Prompt sharing by asking open-ended questions. Offer praise for participation. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Group mixed-ability students to facilitate peer learning. Provide additional resources for early finishers.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure that all students pronounce multisyllabic words correctly. Monitor and correct sentences that use past tenses instead of present simple.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage active participation by setting clear expectations. Use timers for activities to manage time effectively.
