### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                   | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins    | Begin with a simple icebreaker game like "Two Truths and a Lie" related to problem-solving scenarios. Each student tells two true statements and one false one related to their past problem-solving experiences. Encourage students to guess which is false. This reduces anxiety and fosters an interactive, comfortable learning environment. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins    | Introduce critical thinking with a short video clip demonstrating a simple problem-solving scenario. Pause for students to predict the solution and express ideas in pairs. This provides context and engages students' prior knowledge. Follow with a brief discussion as a class to set the lesson's thematic focus.                                           |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins    | Provide a model dialogue between two people discussing potential solutions to a given problem. Students listen and note key phrases and vocabulary. Discussion is followed by peer analysis to highlight language structures. This engages students in observing natural language use, while encouraging peer support through collaboration and analysis.    |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins    | Conduct an engaging "Vocabulary Bingo" game where students listen for key terms related to critical thinking and problem-solving. Use a mixture of definitions, synonyms, and example sentences. Bingo game cards include vocabulary terms. This bridges language exposure with fun and ensures active participation through game-based learning.              |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins    | In groups, students select a common problem (e.g., environmental) and brainstorm solutions. Provide graphic organizers to outline their ideas using key language and structures. Monitor to offer guidance and feedback. This scaffolds their thinking and aids structured preparation, fostering both accuracy and fluency in the planning phase.                  |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins    | Facilitate a "Problem-Solving Debate." Each group presents their solution, defending their ideas, and questioning others. Use sentence starters and visual aids to support students. Offer a formative assessment by circulating and noting effective language use and areas for improvement. The activity encourages spontaneous, meaningful interaction and argumentation.        |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conclude with whole-class feedback. Highlight successful strategies and common mistakes, using audio recordings to provide precise examples. Encourage peer feedback to reinforce learning. Offer corrective feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, emphasizing student strengths and areas for development.                                         |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins     | Address emergent questions or revisit key points as necessary. Use this time to wrap up the lesson smoothly, ensuring all participants have clear understanding of today’s activities and goals.                                                                                                                                                        |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Pair advanced students with those needing more guidance during group tasks to balance the dynamic and promote peer learning.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Keep an eye on overuse of native language; encourage students to use English consistently.
- **Classroom Management:** Arrange seating in a way that encourages interaction, such as circles or U-shapes, to facilitate communication and engagement.
