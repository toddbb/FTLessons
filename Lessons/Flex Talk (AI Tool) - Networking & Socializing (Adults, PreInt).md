|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins          | Begin the class with a brief icebreaker activity. Ask students to pair up and find three things they have in common with their partner. Encourage communication by asking open-ended questions. Rotate pairs to ensure students converse with different classmates. Monitor and assist if necessary, checking for vocabulary usage and engagement. | Use this opportunity to assess students’ initial speaking confidence. Encourage informal and relaxed interaction. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins          | Introduce the topic of networking in both professional and informal contexts. Display images of networking events and casual gatherings using the projector and elicit students’ thoughts on the differences in communication styles. Facilitate a short discussion, prompting students to brainstorm reasons why networking is important. Note key vocabulary on the board. | Engage students by connecting the topic to real-life experiences. Prompt them with targeted questions to activate prior knowledge. |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins          | Share an authentic audio clip of a networking interaction. Provide students with a listening task to identify key expressions and topics discussed. Follow up with a detailed analysis of the language used in greetings, self-introductions, and conversing about interests. Highlight differences between formal and informal interactions. Guide students to analyze intonation and stress within the conversation. Integrate comprehension checks and peer discussion. | Provide audio with a transcript for visual learners. Encourage peer explanations for better understanding. |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins          | Conduct a game-based activity called “Networking Bingo”. Distribute bingo cards with various conversational phrases and topics related to networking. Students circulate the room to find classmates to converse with and complete their bingo cards by asking questions or making statements using the phrases. This activity promotes dynamic and active engagement in speaking. Monitor interactions, providing feedback and support as needed. | Encourage students to use natural conversation rather than sticking rigidly to phrases. Offer praise to boost confidence. |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins          | Form students into small groups and provide each group with a role-play card describing a networking scenario. Guide them through the process of planning their interactions. Emphasize preparation of key introductions, topics to discuss, and questions to ask. Use scaffolding techniques such as providing sentence starters and organizing their ideas using graphic organizers. Conduct a quick check to ensure understanding and readiness. | Use strategic pairing for peer support and language modeling. Ensure students understand the context of their scenarios. |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins          | Transition students into role-play exercises where they practice networking and socializing within their given scenarios. Encourage creativity and spontaneity as students simulate real-life interactions. Allow plenty of time for exchanges and provide formative feedback during the activity. Rotate to facilitate all groups, taking notes on language use, and providing prompts for authentic communication. Capture common challenges and successes to discuss later. | Keep participation high by ensuring equal speaking opportunities. Gently prompt quieter students to participate. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins          | Conduct a feedback session where students reflect on their role-play experiences. Encourage peer feedback by discussing what strategies worked well and what could be improved. Provide targeted corrective feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary usage observed during the role-plays. Highlight successful interactions and language use. Compile a list of useful expressions and phrases that emerged during the lesson. | Balance feedback by focusing on both positive aspects and areas for improvement. Use examples from the class to illustrate points. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins (Optional) | Open the floor for any questions or comments from the lesson. Address any emergent needs or clarify uncertainties. If time permits, use a short digital quiz via Kahoot to reinforce vocabulary and concepts covered in the lesson. | Encourage student-led inquiry and discussion. Use technology to maintain engagement. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use peer support and mixed-ability grouping to support diverse learning needs. Offer additional scaffolding for less confident students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Monitor for overuse of scripted language in interactive activities. Encourage natural adaptation of learned phrases.
- **Classroom Management:** Foster a respectful and supportive environment. Reinforce positive interactions and maintain a positive tone throughout activities.
