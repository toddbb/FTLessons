| **Stage**                      | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Instruction Tips**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins    | Start with an interactive game using Kahoot to introduce the topic of multiculturalism. Prepare questions that spark interest and curiosity, such as "What does multiculturalism mean?" or "Can you name any multicultural cities?" This game will help activate prior knowledge and engage students from the start. Ensure that the questions are varied and inclusive of basic definitions and trivia to create a lively atmosphere. Encourage students to discuss their responses with a partner after each question to maximize interaction. | Maintain a high-energy atmosphere. Use visual aids and images of multicultural settings to support the quiz. Emphasize pair discussions after each question to increase student talk time and reinforce understanding.                                                        |

| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins    | Present a short video or series of images depicting multicultural environments. Ask students to work in pairs to discuss what they observed, emphasizing the diversity and inclusion depicted. Use guided questions like "What different cultures did you notice?" and "What challenges might arise in these settings?" Encourage students to make personal connections by reflecting on their own experiences with diversity. This will help students to share real-life experiences and set the context for deeper exploration of the topic.            | Select culturally sensitive and relatable materials. Encourage students to speak from personal experience and facilitate a supportive environment where they feel comfortable sharing. Use visual aids to highlight key points and trigger discussions.                           |

| **Present Model**            | 15 mins    | Introduce an authentic article or excerpt on multiculturalism. Provide students with a task to identify vocabulary related to the topic, such as 'multicultural', 'diversity', etc. Use a jigsaw reading activity where students in groups read different sections of the text and then share their findings with their peers. The aim is to allow students to engage actively with the material, fostering collaboration and conversation on the topic. Provide graphic organizers to help them organize their thoughts and findings.                      | Pre-teach essential vocabulary before the reading activity. Use think-aloud strategies to model how to identify key vocabulary in texts. Provide sentence starters to support discussion after reading. Monitor and assist groups as needed to ensure understanding.                    |

| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins    | Conduct a vocabulary matching game. Provide students with cards containing vocabulary words on one side and their definitions on the other. Students will work in pairs to match the words to their correct definitions. This reinforces the vocabulary in a fun and interactive manner. Once the pairs think they have matched all the words, they must justify their choices to another pair, promoting peer teaching. This step enhances retention by integrating interaction and active engagement with the vocabulary.                                              | Break down the task into clear steps. Demonstrate how to use context clues from example sentences to match definitions. Offer immediate corrective feedback. Provide additional context for each vocabulary word through example sentences or real-life scenarios.                    |

| **Preparation**              | 15 mins    | Allow students time to individually prepare a short statement or mini-presentation on their perspective or experience with multiculturalism. They should utilize the vocabulary and phrases learned earlier. Model the activity by giving your own brief presentation, highlighting structure (introduction, body, conclusion), and using key phrases. Encourage students to plan their points using graphic organizers that outline their central message and supporting arguments or experiences.                                               | Provide sentence starters and visual prompts on the whiteboard to guide their statements. Encourage paired practice before the presentations to build confidence. Offer examples of transitional phrases to improve speech coherence.                                              |

| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins    | Facilitate a roundtable discussion where students share their prepared statements about multiculturalism. Encourage questions and peer feedback using sentence stems like "I agree because..." or "Have you considered...?" This stage allows for spontaneous interaction and helps students practice expressing their ideas clearly and fluently. Foster an environment where students feel comfortable sharing differing opinions and perspectives. Regularly circulate to provide support and ensure respectful and constructive dialogue.                      | Monitor student interaction to guide the discussion and provide on-the-spot error correction when necessary. Use open-ended questions to elicit expanded responses. Encourage listening skills by highlighting the importance of acknowledging others' viewpoints before responding. |

| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins    | Conclude with whole-class feedback. Highlight common errors heard during the discussion and provide correction and alternatives. Use a positive approach, focusing equally on what was done well. Encourage students to self-correct by revisiting some statements they made and brainstorming on how to make them clearer or more accurate. Use visual aids to revisit essential vocabulary and pronunciation. Allow students to reflect on their learning by writing a brief self-assessment or completing a peer feedback form.                          | Provide constructive feedback that balances positive reinforcement with areas for improvement. Use examples from the class discussion to illustrate key points and corrections. Encourage self-reflection by asking students to consider one thing they did well and one thing to improve. |

| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins     | Open the floor for any emergent questions or discussions. Use this time to address any specific concerns or areas of confusion that arose during the lesson. If no questions arise, use a quick recap activity where students summarize what they've learned today.                                  | Be flexible in addressing student needs. Use this opportunity for any final clarifications or to deepen understanding where interest is shown. Engage students in briefly discussing further areas of interest for future lessons on related topics.                              |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiation: Use tiered vocabulary lists to accommodate various proficiency levels.
- Common pitfalls: Students may struggle with unfamiliar vocabulary. Ensure pre-teaching and scaffolding are thorough.
- Classroom Management: Foster a respectful and positive classroom environment to encourage sharing of personal experiences.
