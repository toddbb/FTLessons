|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Start with a game called "Stream It or Skip It." Divide students into small groups and hand out cards with different TV show and movie titles from various streaming services. Each group discusses and decides if they would stream or skip the show and why. This activity is meant to build rapport and generate interest in the topic of streaming services and media.                                                   | Use popular and varied titles tailored to student interests. Encourage students to use English when voting and explaining their choices.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Show a short video clip highlighting the rise of streaming services, emphasizing how they have changed media consumption. Conduct a brief class discussion about what students noticed and how they engage with media. Ask guiding questions like, "What streaming services do you use, and why?" and "How do your viewing habits differ from those of your parents?" This sets the context for analyzing media trends.       | Use visually engaging clips and ensure all students can see and hear properly. Encourage students to share experiences with streaming services.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Present a model dialogue where two people discuss the pros and cons of streaming versus traditional media. Use a script highlighting key phrases and vocabulary. Have students listen and follow along. Then, identify and extract the target language, such as expressing opinions and contrasting ideas. Ensure students understand by asking comprehension questions and having them repeat key phrases.                | Use clear, well-paced delivery. Pause at key points to explain new vocabulary and check understanding with targeted questions.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Engage students in a game called "Vocabulary Bingo." Provide students with a bingo card filled with target vocabulary related to streaming and traditional media. Call out definitions, and students must find and mark the corresponding words. This helps them review and familiarize themselves with essential terminology, setting a strong foundation for the main discussion activities.                                                | Clarify any unfamiliar terms before starting the game. Use a projector to display definitions and ensure active participation by incentivizing winners with small prizes.                                                                                                                          |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Divide students into groups to prepare for a debate on "Are streaming services better than traditional media?" Assign each group a position (for or against) and give them the preparation handout with sentence starters, graphic organizers, and key points to consider. Students must collaborate to gather information and plan their arguments, enhancing group dynamics and critical thinking skills.                                | Provide scaffolding through a guided framework, including sentence starters and vocabulary lists. Monitor groups and provide support as needed. Encourage peer support and collaboration.                                                                                                          |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Conduct a structured debate where students present their arguments on streaming versus traditional media. Each group comes to the front, presents their points, and engages in a Q&A session with the opposing side. This allows students to practice speaking fluency and confidence in a structured, real-world simulation. Use formative assessments by taking notes on language use and fluency.                                 | Set clear rules for the debate, ensuring respectful and constructive interactions. Remind students to use the target language phrases and monitor their use of English throughout. Provide immediate and specific feedback after each presentation.                                                   |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide feedback on students' performance during the debate. Focus on language accuracy, use of target language, and overall communication effectiveness. Discuss common errors and areas for improvement, reinforcing strengths. Allow students to self-reflect and peer-review to promote self-regulated learning and peer support. Offer corrective models for any persistent language issues identified.                    | Use a positive and supportive tone. Highlight successful language use and provide clear examples for correction. Encourage students to take notes and ask questions to deepen understanding.                                                                                                      |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Use this time for students to ask any additional questions or clarify misunderstandings from the lesson. Address emergent needs or extend an activity if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Be flexible and responsive to student needs. Encourage an open and inclusive classroom environment where all students feel comfortable asking questions.                                                                                                                                             |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Tailor the complexity of debate preparation materials according to student proficiency levels. Offer extra prompts or language support where necessary.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may default to L1 during debates; encourage strict use of English and model transitions for moving back to English if this occurs.
- **Classroom Management:** Use timers to keep activities on track and maintain engagement, especially during debates and discussions.
