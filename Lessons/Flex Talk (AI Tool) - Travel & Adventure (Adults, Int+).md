### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures:

| **Stage**        | **Timing** | **Extensive Activity Description and Instructions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Instruction Tips** |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Warmer           | 10 mins    | Start the class with a "Travel Bingo" game. Prepare bingo cards with different travel experiences (e.g., "traveled abroad," "took a train," "stayed in a hotel"). Students move around the room asking each other questions to find someone who fits a category. For example, “Have you ever traveled abroad?” If the answer is yes, they write the name on their card. The aim is to complete a line. | Encourage students to use complete questions and practice follow-up questions. |
| Lead-In/Set Context | 10 mins  | Show a short travel video that depicts scenarios of a traveler navigating through a new city. After watching, ask the students to discuss in pairs what they found exciting or challenging about travel based on the video. Elicit responses as a class discussion to activate prior knowledge and set the context for the lesson.                                                   | Use visual aids to stimulate interest and encourage expressive language.    |
| Present Model    | 15 mins    | Present students with a dialogue between a traveler and a hotel receptionist. Use an audio clip or role-play script to illustrate making a reservation. Students listen for specific information (e.g., check-in times, special requests). Follow with comprehension questions. Discuss the expressions used and identify key phrases related to booking and requests.                                         | Provide students with transcripts to follow along and highlight useful phrases. |
| Useful Language  | 15 mins    | Conduct a "Phrase Building" board game. Prepare a board with travel-related scenarios. In groups, students move pieces around the board and pick cards that require them to make suggestions, requests, or give advice using modal verbs (e.g., "You should visit the local museum."). As they land on scenario spaces, they work collaboratively to use phrases in context.                            | Model example sentences and reinforce language structures through peer correction. |
| Preparation      | 15 mins    | Students prepare for a role-play activity by drafting a short travel itinerary and generating questions they may need to ask someone they meet during travel (e.g., “Where is the nearest subway station?”). Encourage students to use the target vocabulary and structures. They rehearse in pairs, refining their pronunciation and sentence structures.                                          | Walk around to provide support and feedback as students practice.          |
| Complete Task    | 35 mins    | Engage in role-play scenarios where students act out travel situations. One student acts as a traveler, and the other as a local or service provider. They rotate partners to practice different situations such as asking for directions, making complaints, or booking activities. Use travel brochures as prompts for additional questions or interactions. Provide brief feedback after each interaction.        | Encourage spontaneous language use while highlighting effective communication strategies. |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback emphasizing correct use of target language and natural communication. Use examples from student interactions to correct errors and highlight effective language use. Allow students time to self-correct and to practice corrected sentences aloud.                                                                                                                                  | Focus on positive reinforcement and future improvement areas.              |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiation strategies include providing additional sentence starters for students who need them and more complex scenarios for advanced groups.
- Anticipate common errors with past tense and modals, and have exercises ready to address these.
- Use classroom management techniques to ensure equal participation, such as assigning rotating roles in group activities.
