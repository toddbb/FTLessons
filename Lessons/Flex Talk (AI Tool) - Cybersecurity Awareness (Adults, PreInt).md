|-----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins| Begin with a cybersecurity quiz on the digital platform. Students work in pairs to complete the quiz, answering questions about common online threats. Use this activity to build interest and assess their current understanding. Engage in a short discussion about their quiz answers, allowing students to share experiences related to cybersecurity incidents. Prepare students by distributing vocabulary handouts for reference during the activity.                                                                                                                                                      | Use visual aids or a short video to introduce the concept. Ensure all students have access to devices. Encourage students to discuss terms they are unsure of.                                                                                                      |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins| Show images of cybersecurity threats such as phishing emails, malware alerts, and password prompts. Facilitate a think-pair-share activity: students think individually about how these threats impact their lives, discuss in pairs, and then share with the class. Highlight the importance of cybersecurity awareness in daily digital interactions. Use this activity to activate prior knowledge and allow learners to connect personally with the topic, thus making it more relevant and engaging. Provide sentence starters to support students’ sharing in English.                              | Use visuals to scaffold understanding of threats. Monitor pairs to support low-talk students. Encourage sharing by providing prompts such as "I think...", "In my experience...", "A threat I know about is...".                                                     |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins| Present a video featuring a cybersecurity expert discussing common online threats and safe online practices. Students will have a task to listen for specific information: list three threats mentioned and two solutions suggested. After watching, students will compare their notes in small groups and discuss any new terms. Use graphic organizers to help students organize the information as they watch. Emphasize key phrases and vocabulary through subtitles and annotations. This stage aids in contextual understanding and focuses on accurate note-taking.                           | Pause the video at key points to model note-taking. Encourage active listening by posing pre-watching questions. Highlight difficult vocabulary on the board. Offer additional viewing for those needing more support.                                              |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins| Conduct a "Password Charades" game to reinforce vocabulary. Split students into teams, where one member acts out terms like "phishing" and "firewall" without speaking, while their team guesses the word. This activity reinforces vocabulary comprehension in an interactive way. Use this stage to practice pronunciation and ensure students are comfortable with the target language through playful engagement. Conclude with pronunciation drills for challenging words. Maintain a clear focus on key terms necessary for discussing cybersecurity effectively.                                         | Make sure each team has a turn. Encourage students to guess using full sentences. Monitor for correct pronunciation. Highlight the importance of tone and body language in communicating ideas non-verbally.                                                        |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins| Organize students into small groups, assigning each group a specific cybersecurity threat to research and discuss (e.g., phishing, malware). Provide graphic organizers to structure their findings and planning. Encourage groups to prepare a short role-play scenario illustrating how the threat can be avoided. Provide language structures and vocabulary from the handout as supports. This preparation enables organized thoughts and supports language accuracy. Offer scaffolding by reviewing grammar points, and provide sentence starters to ensure clarity and completeness in their role-plays.                  | Provide clear roles within groups to promote engagement. Walk around, listening in and providing feedback or corrections as needed. Guide students to use specific vocabulary when explaining their threat. Offer extra help to groups struggling with the task.                     |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins| Conduct role-play enactments where each group presents their assigned threat and demonstrates safety tips through an interactive scenario. Encourage audience engagement by allowing classmates to ask questions and offer additional safety tips after each presentation. This stage promotes fluency in a realistic setting by asking students to put into practice what they have prepared. Use formative assessment by noting vocabulary usage, language structure, and clarity of explanations. This also aids in enhancing public speaking skills and confidence.                     | Keep the environment supportive and positive to encourage performance. Allow peers to provide feedback with structured guidelines (e.g., one positive comment, one suggestion). Ensure that all group members participate equally.                                      |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Facilitate a constructive feedback session. Highlight common language errors related to grammar and pronunciation, providing correct models. Emphasize strengths observed during task completion, such as effective vocabulary usage and teamwork. Allow students to self-reflect by discussing the role-play experience and what they learned about cybersecurity. This reflective activity serves as an opportunity for critical thinking and deeper understanding of the topic. Regular feedback loops improve language accuracy and growth over time.                                     | Use specific examples to clarify errors and corrections. Encourage students to evaluate their peers gently and constructively. Allow students time to rewrite one sentence or role-play section correctly based on feedback.                                        |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins | Open the floor for any remaining questions, clarifying points of confusion. Encourage students to review vocabulary handouts and note crucial takeaways on cybersecurity awareness. This stage allows for last-minute queries and reinforces the day's key learnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Use this time to provide individual support to quieter students or engage in brief, personalized conversations about their progress. Encourage note-taking for continuous improvement.                                                                               |
