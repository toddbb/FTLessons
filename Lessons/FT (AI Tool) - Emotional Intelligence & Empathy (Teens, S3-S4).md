| Stage                    | Timing  | Extensive Activity Description and Instructions                                                                                             | Teacher Notes and Tips                                                      |
|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**               | 10 mins | Start the lesson with a "Feelings Charades" game. In this activity, each student picks an emotion card and acts it out while others guess. This encourages engagement and lowers affective filters. The emotions should be simple (e.g., happy, sad, angry). Ensure students have sentence starters like "I think you feel..." to guess emotions. | Ensure cards are appropriate to students’ language level. Keep energy high and provide praise.                  |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**| 10 mins | Introduce the topic using a series of images showing different emotional scenarios. Ask students to describe what they see using target vocabulary. Use guiding questions like "How do you think this person feels?" to activate prior knowledge and build new connections. | Encourage peer interaction to generate more ideas. Use real-life scenarios to make it relatable.                   |
| **Present Model**        | 15 mins | Present a short dialogue in which two people demonstrate understanding and empathy (e.g., "I'm sorry to hear you're upset. Do you want to talk about it?"). Play a recording or read it out, asking students to listen for key phrases related to empathy. Follow this by highlighting specific expressions using visual aids while students note down new vocabulary in their handouts. | Model the dialogue with clear pronunciation and intonation. Engage students with prediction questions.     |
| **Useful Language**      | 15 mins | Conduct a vocabulary game like "Emotional Bingo," where students listen for specific words in a story. Prepare bingo cards with target vocabulary related to emotions and empathy. Read a story, and students mark whenever they hear a word on their card. This reinforces vocabulary retention and listening skills in an engaging manner. | Introduce the vocabulary using visual aids before playing. Monitor and assist students as needed. Ensure each student participates actively.        |
| **Preparation**          | 15 mins | In pairs, students prepare a short role-play including elements of emotional intelligence and empathy. Provide a scenario (e.g., helping a friend who's nervous about an exam). Students use a graphic organizer to plan their dialogue, using sentence starters and target vocabulary. Regularly check in to guide them. | Scaffold with sentence stems and dialogue structures. Offer feedback during planning. Adjust scenarios based on students’ interests and levels. |
| **Complete Task**        | 35 mins | Have students perform their role-plays in front of the class or in small groups. Encourage the audience to give positive feedback using sentence frames (e.g., "I liked how you showed..."). This activity emphasizes student-centered learning and speaking practice. Facilitate peer support throughout. | Create a supportive environment to build confidence. Focus on communication rather than perfection. Allow some flexibility in language use.       |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conduct a class feedback session, highlighting correct use of empathy-related language and providing constructive feedback on areas to improve. Use examples from the role-plays to demonstrate points. Encourage self-reflection by asking students what they found challenging and enjoyable. | Use gentle correction and positive reinforcement. Focus on major speaking errors and suggest improvements. Provide additional phrases if needed.                                               |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**     | 5 mins  | Allow students to ask any questions or clarify doubts. Use this time to summarize the lesson’s key points and vocabulary. Encourage students to reflect on how they can use emotional intelligence in their daily lives.  | Foster an open communication environment. Be open to unplanned but valuable discussions.                    |
