### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins| Begin by asking students to think of a time when they worked in a team. Encourage brief sharing with a partner. Transition into a quick "Teamword Charades." Divide the class into small groups, and give each group cards with teamwork-related words (e.g., collaborate, goal, support). One student acts out the word without speaking, and the group guesses. This activity builds rapport and introduces key vocabulary in an engaging way. Scaffold by pre-teaching strategies for guessing and miming. Use formative assessment through observation to offer immediate feedback on participation and usage of new vocabulary. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins| Set the context by showing a short video clip illustrating effective teamwork. Pause and discuss key moments, encouraging students to identify what made the teamwork successful. Ask guiding questions like "What strategies did the team use?", "How did they communicate?" Use this as a bridge to pre-teach language structures for expressing opinions. Promote peer support by having students discuss in pairs before sharing with the class. Check comprehension through targeted questioning. |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins| Provide a model dialogue between two team members planning a group task. Play the audio recording, or read the dialogue aloud. Set a task for students to listen and note down phrases used for suggesting ideas and agreeing/disagreeing. Emphasize vocabulary and functional language within the dialogue. Display a visual organizer with key phrases and sentences. Engage students in chorally repeating key phrases with attention to pronunciation. Activate student interaction by asking pairs to reconstruct the dialogue, using the visual aid. |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins| Conduct a "Phrase Matching" game. Prepare cards with common phrases for teamwork; half with the beginnings of sentences and half with sentence endings. Distribute randomly and challenge students to find their match among classmates. Model the activity by demonstrating a couple of examples and checking comprehension. As students circulate and find matches, they practice reading aloud. Monitor and assist students, providing corrective feedback. This activity is designed to be interactive and supportive, with built-in peer collaboration. |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins| Assign groups a small project, e.g., planning a class event or group presentation. Use graphic organizers to help students plan tasks, assign roles, and set goals. Encourage students to use target language and vocabulary during planning. Scaffold by circulating, offering language support, and facilitating discussions as needed. Provide sentence starters to aid structuring their plans. Include formative assessment by checking in with each group, offering feedback and guidance. Ensure students are prepared to articulate their team's plan clearly. |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins| Facilitate the main task where groups execute their project plans. They simulate the collaboration process and aim to achieve their goals. Build autonomy by allowing students to lead the activity, while offering support as needed. Students should use the vocabulary and phrases learned throughout the lesson. Encourage participation by having each group present their completed task to the class. Use an audio device to record their presentations for subsequent feedback. Utilize peer assessment by having groups ask questions and provide feedback to each other, creating a dynamic learning environment. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session, playing back recordings of the group task. Provide constructive feedback on teamwork, language usage, and pronunciation. Highlight successful language use and areas needing improvement. Offer group-specific and individualized feedback. Encourage peer feedback by prompting students to offer constructive comments to each other. Use this opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and reinforce effective techniques. Conclude with a reflection activity, asking students to write down one thing they learned and one area to improve, promoting self-assessment. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer** (Optional) | 5 mins | Use this time to address any emergent questions or clarify concepts as needed. Tailor the buffer activity based on students' interests or challenges encountered during the lesson. Can include additional practice, Q&A, or quick review game. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiate tasks based on students' proficiency within the B1-B2 range by varying complexity in dialogues and projects.
- Anticipate challenges in pronunciation and provide additional practice where needed.
- Manage classroom transitions smoothly between activities to maintain engagement.
- Utilize inclusive groupings to balance stronger and weaker students, fostering a supportive learning environment.
