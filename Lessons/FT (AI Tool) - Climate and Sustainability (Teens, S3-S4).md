|----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                     | 10 mins| To begin, create a dynamic atmosphere by playing a quick game of "Environmental Bingo." Hand out bingo cards that have terms related to climate and sustainability. The teacher reads out definitions, and students mark the matching words on their cards. The first student to complete a line shouts "Bingo!" and wins a small prize. This activity activates background knowledge and engages students through a fun and competitive format, setting the stage for the lesson topic.                                       | Ensure clear instructions and demonstrate with an example if needed. Use visuals on the board to explain unfamiliar terms quickly.                          |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Show a short, engaging video clip about an environmental issue like climate change. After watching, ask students to discuss in pairs: “What problems did you see?” and “How can we help?”. This provides a visual context and starts students thinking about the topic. Monitor discussions and provide scaffolding by circulating and assisting students with expressions or ideas.                                                                                                       | Use a projector for clear viewing. Pause if needed to explain key moments. Encourage all students to share in pairs, aiming to reduce teacher talk.        |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Present a dialogue between two characters discussing recycling and renewable energy. Students listen first without taking notes to understand general meaning. Then, pair students and give them the dialogue script. Assign roles and have them perform the dialogue, using sentence starters like "I think we should..." and "What about you?". This student-centered approach allows practice in a meaningful context and encourages peer support.                                               | Emphasize pronunciation and intonation while reading the dialogue. Offer support by circulating and listening to pairs, correcting any major errors.       |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Play a vocabulary matching game using flashcards. Display words related to climate and sustainability on one side of the board and their definitions on the other. Students race to match them correctly. Follow up with a team-based Kahoot quiz on vocabulary meanings, ensuring active participation. This game-based activity reinforces key vocabulary while fostering competition and collaboration.                                                               | Keep the atmosphere light and encourage quick responses. Provide positive feedback and hints when necessary to keep the game moving and engaging.           |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| In groups, students plan a short presentation on one aspect of sustainability (e.g., recycling, reducing pollution, renewable energy). Provide a graphic organizer to help structure their ideas with sections for introduction, main points, and conclusion. As they prepare, scaffold by circulating and offering sentence starters and checking for comprehension. Make sure students understand the expectations for each part.                                    | Remind students of the sentence starters and useful phrases on the board. Offer guidance to groups that seem stuck or unsure. Encourage idea sharing.      |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Groups present their sustainability plans to the class. Encourage peer feedback by having the audience note down two positive points and one suggestion for improvement. During each presentation, the teacher should take notes for detailed feedback. This main task aims to develop fluency through authentic communicative practice while reinforcing the lesson's vocabulary and structures.                                                              | Set clear guidelines for timing and content. Make sure all group members contribute. Facilitate a supportive atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable presenting. |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Provide feedback based on the presentations, focusing on pronunciation, use of vocabulary, and grammar. Use examples from student speech to highlight strengths and areas for improvement. Offer correct forms and model sentences. Finish the session with a quick group reflection on what was learned and what strategies helped them most. This stage consolidates learning and encourages further improvement.                                                         | Keep feedback balanced with positive and constructive points. Encourage students to self-correct and reflect on their learning process.                     |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)| 5 mins | Open floor for any questions or a quick activity like "Two Truths and a Lie" using environmental facts to reinforce learning if time permits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Adapt activity choice based on student interest or use it to address emergent issues. Maintain lesson focus and manage time effectively.                    |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Pair stronger students with those who may need support during the pair and group activities. Use visual aids like word maps for those needing extra help with vocabulary.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Watch for over-reliance on reading details during presentations. Encourage students to use bullet points rather than full sentences to prompt their speech.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain a lively and supportive tone, ensuring all students are engaging actively. Use positive reinforcement to motivate participation.
