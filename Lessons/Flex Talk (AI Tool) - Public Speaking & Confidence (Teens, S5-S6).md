| Stages                           | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Instruction Tips                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                       | 10 mins| Begin with a "Whisper Down the Lane" game to get students relaxed and engaged. Line up the students and have a sentence related to public speaking whispered from one end to the other. The last student says it aloud to see if it matches the original. This game serves as an icebreaker and introduces the topic subtly, warming them up for the lesson. Explain how communicating messages clearly is essential in public speaking.                                | Monitor the activity to ensure students stay on task. Use humor to break any tension. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**        | 10 mins| Share a short audio clip of a famous speech (e.g., Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream") and ask students what makes it effective. This will activate their prior knowledge and introduce them to the importance of confident public speaking. Initiate a class discussion on what they noticed, such as tone, pace, clarity, and emotion, to set the context. Use a whiteboard to jot down their ideas to build a collaborative understanding of effective speech elements.      | Encourage all students to participate. Validate all responses to foster inclusivity. |
| **Present Model**                | 15 mins| Play an example of a well-structured short speech. Provide students with a transcript highlighting the vocabulary and structural elements that make it effective. Ask students to work in pairs to identify the introduction, body, and conclusion. Check their answers and model how to use these components in their speeches. Emphasize how transitions and rhetorical questions enhance engagement. Students should note these features on handouts for reference.              | Prompt students with guiding questions if needed.                                 |
| **Useful Language**              | 15 mins| Introduce a game-based activity: "Speech Card Swap". Provide each student with a card containing a phrase or vocabulary from the lesson, such as "convincing argument," "engaging opening," or "summarize key points." Students walk around the room, swapping cards, and using the phrases to construct hypothetical speech sentences when prompted. This activity reinforces vocabulary in a dynamic way, boosting retention through repetition and movement.        | Encourage students to use varied sentence starters for practice.                   |
| **Preparation**                  | 15 mins| Students begin planning their short persuasive speech on a topic of their choice. Offer a graphic organizer to structure their ideas into the introduction, body, and conclusion. Circulate the room to provide guidance and feedback. This scaffolding helps them organize thoughts logically and coherently, supporting students who struggle with structuring their content. Encourage peer discussion to brainstorm ideas and gain new perspectives.                          | Utilize formative assessments by asking probing questions during planning.          |
| **Complete Task**                | 35 mins| In groups of 3-4, students practice delivering their speeches. They take turns speaking, while peers provide feedback using a checklist focused on clarity, confidence, structure, and vocabulary use. Rotate to each group, offering personalized feedback and encouragement. This collaborative setting enables peer support and gradual confidence building, facilitating authentic, meaningful interaction. Progressively reduce support to promote independent production. | Foster a supportive environment; celebrate improvements. Ensure equal speaking time. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**    | 15 mins| Conduct a class reflection and feedback session. Allow students to share what they found challenging or successful. Provide constructive feedback emphasizing improvements in accuracy and fluency. Celebrate strengths, but also address common errors, providing corrected examples for students to learn from. Use positive language to encourage further practice. Ensure feedback is actionable and clearly linked to lesson objectives.                              | Use error correction techniques that focus on growth and encouragement.             |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**             | 5 mins | Address any emergent needs. Clarify lingering questions or allow additional practice for students needing it. Use this time to highlight exceptional performances, reinforcing motivation and confidence among learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Be adaptive to the class's needs; this can also be a moment for casual conversation.  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide differentiated sentence starters or speech templates for students needing extra help. Offer extension activities for advanced learners, such as incorporating multimedia in their speeches.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid overwhelming students by introducing too many new vocabulary terms at once. Prioritize interactive activities and peer feedback to minimize anxiety.
- **Classroom Management:** Set clear rules for feedback during peer reviews to maintain a respectful and supportive atmosphere.
