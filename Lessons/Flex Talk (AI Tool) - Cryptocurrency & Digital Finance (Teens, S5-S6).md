### Lesson Procedures

| Stage             | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer            | 10 mins| Begin with an energizing icebreaker related to technology. Pose a question, "What's something tech-related you've learned recently?" Have students share in pairs, followed by a few volunteers sharing with the class. This activity activates prior knowledge and sets a relaxed tone. Scaffold with sentence starters: "Recently, I learned about..." or "I'm curious about...".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins| Show a 2-minute video introducing cryptocurrency basics. Instruct students to listen for key terms, such as Bitcoin, transaction, and blockchain. After viewing, conduct a brief whole-class discussion. Elicit prior knowledge and assumptions about cryptocurrency, and write these on the board. Use visual aids to illustrate complex ideas. Check understanding with questions like, "What is Bitcoin used for?" and "How do people use digital wallets?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Present Model     | 15 mins| Display presentation slides with clear definitions and examples of target vocabulary. Use visuals to explain each concept, such as a diagram of blockchain technology. Encourage students to take notes. Model clear pronunciation and have students repeat after you. Engage students with guided examples: "Here is how a transaction works..." Provide a short sentence completion activity as they listen. Use peer support by having students work in pairs to practice saying each term and discussing their definitions.                                            |
| Useful Language   | 15 mins| Introduce a competitive vocabulary game using pair/group competitions. Divide the class into small groups. Each group receives a handout with vocabulary words and definitions. Groups race to match words with their definitions correctly. Include sentence starters in the handout, such as "A blockchain is used for...". After the game, discuss and clarify any misunderstandings. This game-based activity reinforces vocabulary while maintaining a low teacher-to-student talk ratio. Monitor and provide feedback during the activity.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Preparation       | 15 mins| In pairs, students prepare a short dialogue where they discuss the pros and cons of using cryptocurrency. Provide prompts and scaffolding: "One advantage is...", "However, there is a risk of...". Encourage students to use as many target words as possible. As students plan, circulate and provide guidance, ensuring they use language accurately. Offer hints if necessary and encourage peer correction. This prepares them for the more extended speaking task that follows, fostering collaborative learning and gradually releasing responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Complete Task     | 35 mins| Pairs perform their dialogues in front of a small group. Encourage active listening by assigning each group member to note one positive aspect and one aspect for improvement from the performances. After all pairs have presented, initiate group feedback, focusing on fluency, vocabulary use, and pronunciation. Encourage positive reinforcement and peer evaluation. To consolidate learning, facilitate a whole-class discussion on the most compelling arguments presented. Use formative assessments to identify and address common errors, such as mispronunciations or incorrect usage of terms. Limit teacher talk by letting students drive the learning through discussions. Teacher takes notes for the Feedback stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Feedback/Error Correction| 15 mins| Provide group and individual feedback based on observations from the Complete Task stage. Focus on reinforcing correct usage of targeted vocabulary and pronunciation. Use example sentences from the students’ performances to highlight areas of strength and suggest improvements. Display common errors on the board and guide students through self-correction. Encourage reflective discussions on learning strategies. Conclude with a formative assessment to ensure understanding, using quick Q&A or error-check questions. Maintain encouragement and support throughout. This stage empowers students by clarifying uncertainties and cementing new language skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Flex-time/Buffer  | 5 mins | Allow students to ask questions or further clarify concepts from the lesson. Address emergent needs or interests, or use this time to reinforce particularly tricky concepts. If needed, lead a short impromptu game or fun activity related to the lesson. Adjust based on class dynamics, enhancing engagement and consolidating learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use visual aids, sentence starters, and collaborative group work to accommodate different learning styles and proficiency levels.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students understand abstract concepts by breaking them down into relatable terms and providing real-life examples.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage respectful listening during peer presentations and maintain an inclusive environment where all opinions are valued.
