| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Instruction Tips                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                     | 10 mins| Begin with a game of “Pass the Ball.” Have students stand in a circle and gently pass a ball around. As each student catches the ball, they must say one thing they love about speaking in public or one thing they fear. This activity encourages students to share their feelings openly, thus building rapport and trust. Use this time to assess students' initial attitudes toward public speaking. Encourage shy students by modeling examples of both positive and apprehensive statements. Highlight the idea that everyone has unique perspectives and encourage laughter and positivity.                                                                                                      | Keep energy high and ensure every student participates. Use this to create a safe environment for sharing feelings.                                   |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Show a short clip of a famous public speech. Ask students to identify what makes the speaker effective (e.g., gestures, tone). Lead a brief discussion on how emotions can be conveyed through different public speaking techniques. This primes students to pay attention to non-verbal communication and emotional expression in public speaking, key facets of effective presentation. Encourage students to share their observations and guide them to discover techniques. Use this stage to activate their prior knowledge about impactful presentations and gestures, creating curiosity about learning these skills firsthand. | Use a well-known speech to ensure relatability. Ask open-ended questions to prompt engagement and ideas.                             |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Introduce a simple speech model focusing on structure: Opening, Body, and Close. Provide an example speech: e.g., "Why School Uniforms Should Be Mandatory". Ask students to identify the three parts as they listen. Use a visual aid that outlines speech structure with bullet points. Students work in pairs to paraphrase each part in their own words. This approach allows them to dissect the components of a persuasive speech, emphasizing clarity in structure. Scaffold their understanding of how speeches are composed by guiding them with prompts and questions to structure their observations effectively.                                                                                                           | Use printed copies of the example speech for students to annotate. Encourage active listening by assigning a note-taking task.       |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Conduct a vocabulary game, "Vocabulary Charades." Present key vocabulary such as "persuade," "gesture," "confidence," "emphasize," and "audience." Students act out each word while others guess. This memory-based game is effective in engaging students actively while making vocabulary acquisition enjoyable. By encouraging creative interpretations of vocabulary terms, comprehension and retention are enhanced. Incorporate formative checks by asking students to use each word in a sentence, ensuring their grasp on appropriate usage as they employ the vocabulary within their expressive charades.                                                                                        | Reinforce vocabulary understanding with visual aids. Provide sentence starters for each vocabulary word post-game to deepen learning. |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| Guide students to draft a short persuasive speech on a topic of their interest, using the structural model provided. Supply graphic organizers to plan opening, main points, and conclusion. Pair students to brainstorm ideas, giving peer feedback aligned with friendly criteria that focus on supportive language. Teacher circulates to provide formative assessment checks and clarify misunderstandings. By monitoring student progress and facilitating peer collaboration, students will adopt a more autonomous role in refining their language structures, while consistently receiving guidance to balance accuracy and creativity.                                                                                                         | Offer suggestions to students struggling with ideas. Encourage the use of mind maps or visual aids for inspiration.  |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Organize a "Mini Speech Competition." Students present their drafted speeches to small groups, ensuring an authentic audience experience. Encourage peer feedback using simple criteria: content, clarity, and confidence. Each student scores peers on these criteria. This peer review process not only encourages attentive listening and critical thinking but fosters a supportive environment where students celebrate improvements and achievements together. Give students roles such as timekeepers or introducers to add a cooperative dimension to the task, ensuring full participation and realism. Emphasize constructive feedback, suggesting positive language patterns to focus on encouraging comments.                                                                                | Set clear rules for feedback: positive only. Model giving constructive feedback focusing on strengths.                                   |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Facilitate whole-class feedback by highlighting common strengths observed (use of gestures, clear structure, enthusiasm). Address common errors subtly by reformulating sentences correctly. Summarize what was learned using a mind map on the board, encouraging student contributions. This inclusive approach reinforces learning insights, establishes a shared reflective practice on skills development, and closes the session with a collective sense of achievement and progress. Acknowledge individuality in improvements, ensuring intrinsic motivation is amplified through general praise and recognition of persistent efforts and growth. Assist students in isolating areas for further practice by suggesting personalized goals to strengthen their public speaking journey. | Provide written feedback post-class to individual students focused on achieving personal goals.                                    |
| Flex-time/Buffer           | 5 mins | Allow time for additional questions or discussion if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use this time for any spill-over or emergent teaching opportunities.                                               |
