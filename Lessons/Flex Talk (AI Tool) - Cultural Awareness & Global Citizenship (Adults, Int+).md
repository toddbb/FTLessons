### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage** | **Timing** | **Activity Description** |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with a "Cultural Artifacts Guessing Game." Display or describe various cultural artifacts (photos or real items) from different countries. Students work in small groups to guess the origin and use of each item. Pre-teach vocabulary such as "artifact," "origin," and "custom." Use visuals and a globe for contextual support. Model guessing language and provide sentence starters like "I think this is from... because...". Check comprehension by asking individual students to explain their guesses. Foster a supportive environment to encourage participation. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a short video clip that highlights diverse cultural practices worldwide. Students take notes on surprising or new practices. Pause to ask questions like "What did you find interesting?" to activate prior knowledge and facilitate a participatory discussion. Use prompts like "Have you seen this before?" Offer guided examples of expressing surprise or curiosity. Ensure language comprehension by breaking down complex expressions into simpler terms, enhancing understanding through peer support and collective brainstorming. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Provide sample dialogues focusing on discussing cultural awareness using conditional sentences. Students listen to a short recorded conversation where speakers express opinions on global citizenship. While listening, they fill in missing information in dialogues provided. Check comprehension by asking students to summarize the dialogue. Provide scaffolding through sentence completion exercises and visual prompts. Emphasize intonation patterns for questions. Use guided practice where students repeat parts of the dialogue in pairs, monitoring for accuracy. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Play a vocabulary bingo game focusing on key terms. Prior to the game, introduce vocabulary with simple definitions and example sentences. Use a visual aid with vocabulary grids. Call out definitions, and students mark their terms. Include vocabulary like "identity," "diversity," "tolerance," etc. After the game, conduct a short reflection discussing with peers: "Which words were new to you?" Encourage students to use new vocabulary in sentences. Ensure each pair has a bingo winner to maintain engagement. Offer feedback on pronunciation during this game. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | Plan for a short group project where students present on a cultural topic of choice. Provide an outline template to organize their presentation. Review useful phrases for structuring presentations. Model a brief segment of a presentation. Offer graphic organizers to help with sequencing ideas. Conduct a group memory game with cultural trivia facts. Assign groups based on interest for topics. Rotate among groups to provide individual guidance and check understanding. Monitor fluctuations in motivation and adjust support as needed. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Students conduct and present their cultural topic projects. Encourage them to use conditional sentences to propose solutions to cultural misunderstandings. Peer audience uses a checklist to provide feedback on the presentation style and content. During presentations, listen for effective language usage and note any errors for collective feedback. Facilitate student-led Q&A, promoting authentic interaction. Encourage all students to ask questions and engage actively. Rotate your observation to ensure that each group benefits from feedback. |
| **Feedback / Error Correction** | 15 mins | Facilitate a feedback session. Begin with positive reinforcement of strengths observed during presentations. Address common errors, focusing on language from the model. Use collected notes to highlight pronunciation and grammatical issues. Encourage self-correction by asking guiding questions. Use peer feedback forms for anonymous insights. Offer strategies for overcoming communication barriers. Conduct a quick survey to assess understanding of the global citizen concept. Offer individual support for identified struggles. |
| **Flex-time / Buffer** (Optional) | 5 mins | Allow time for any remaining questions or clarifications. Offer advice on further exploration of cultural awareness using online resources or ESL apps. Present optional homework, such as writing a journal entry reflecting on today's lesson. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide additional resources for students requiring more support. Use peer collaboration strategically with mixed-ability pairing.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with conditional sentence forms; review essential structures if misused frequently.
- **Classroom Management:** Guide group dynamics to ensure fair participation. Use timing cues to keep activities on schedule.
