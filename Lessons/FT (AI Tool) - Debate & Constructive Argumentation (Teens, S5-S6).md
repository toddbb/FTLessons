### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins | Begin with a quick icebreaker called "Agree or Disagree." Display statements on the board (e.g., "Teenagers should have part-time jobs") and ask students to move to one side of the room if they agree and the other if they disagree. Encourage students to explain their reasons. This activity targets language for expressing opinions, activates prior knowledge, and sets a lively tone for the lesson. Pre-teach vocabulary such as "agree," "disagree," and "opinion" using visual aids. Conduct a formative assessment of students’ ability to form basic arguments by listening to their explanations. Encourage peer interaction to build confidence. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins | Show a short video clip of a lively debate. Have students work in pairs to discuss what they noticed about how the speakers presented their arguments. Elicit responses and write key vocabulary and phrases on the board. Use this opportunity to model complex sentences and emphasize modalities used in debates. Tailor support with sentence starters like "I believe that..." and "In addition...". This integrated listening task primes students for the upcoming activities and situates them contextually. |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins | Provide a structured example of a constructive argument through a role-play. Two volunteers act out a short, scripted dialogue, one supporting and one opposing a motion (e.g., "School uniforms should be compulsory"). Students listen and fill out a graphic organizer noting the argument, evidence, and counterarguments presented. Highlight expressions and emphasize their pronunciation through choral repetition. The graphic organizer scaffolds student understanding while peer-supported debriefing reinforces learning. |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins | Engage students in a vocabulary game called "Argument Relay Race." Divide the class into teams. Each team must run to the board, write a relevant word from the lesson, and use it in a sentence related to debate. Focus on interaction by monitoring language accuracy while students construct sentences collaboratively. After the game, conduct a feedback session to address any major language issues. This gamified approach ensures dynamic engagement while reinforcing vocabulary acquisition. |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins | Organize students in small groups, assigning each a position on a debate topic (e.g., "Technology improves education"). Provide graphic organizers for students to plan their main points, evidence, and counterarguments. Circulate the room offering scaffolding questions and sentence starters. Students should practice presenting arguments within their groups with a gradual release of teacher support. While they work, conduct informal assessments via observation and quick check-ins to ensure comprehension. |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins | Host a mini-debate session. Each group presents their arguments, with each member taking turns to speak. Encourage peer evaluation using a checklist focusing on criteria like clarity, persuasiveness, and use of language. After each debate, invite the audience to ask questions or offer counterpoints, fostering a dialogic exchange. This primary task offers students a context for spontaneous language use and consolidates learning in a real-time communicative activity. Consider using video recording for post-task reflection. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conclude with a feedback round where peers offer constructive comments. Focus on reinforcing successful strategies observed during the debates. Address recurrent errors and model corrections for linguistic inaccuracies noticed during the lesson. Utilize visual aids and prompt cards to support explanations and maintain positive reinforcement. This reflective activity consolidates learning, addresses gaps, and promotes continued language development through feedback integration. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiation strategies: Pair stronger speakers with those needing more support.
- Watch for pitfalls such as students dominating the debate. Encourage equal speaking opportunities.
- Effective classroom management: Use a digital timer to keep debate sections on track.
