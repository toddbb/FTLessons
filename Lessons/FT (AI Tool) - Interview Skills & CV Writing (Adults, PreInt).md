|-------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                        | 10 mins| Start the lesson with a quick "Two Truths and a Lie" game to ease tensions and encourage speaking. Each student provides two truths and a lie about themselves related to their professional life (e.g., skills or experiences). Peers must guess which statement is false. This activity fosters an understanding of talking about oneself, which is crucial for CV writing and interviews. **Scaffolding:** Provide sentence starters and model examples to ensure students understand the task. As students share, offer corrective feedback and praise correct grammar usage when necessary.                                                                                                                                                                          | Ensure students use targeted sentence starters. This activity sets a relaxed tone and opens the floor for more personal storytelling.                                  |
| Lead-In / Set Context         | 10 mins| Set the context by asking students to discuss in small groups what makes a CV effective. Use prompts such as "What features should a good CV include?" and "Why is a good CV important for international jobs?" Each group shares their ideas, which the teacher compiles on the board. **Scaffolding:** Use a graphic organizer to highlight components like 'Contact Information', 'Education', 'Experience', and 'Skills' on the board. Conduct a quick formative assessment by questioning students about these components, ensuring they understand what each should entail.                                                                                                                             | Use open-ended questions to foster engagement. Encourage all group members to speak, especially quieter students.                                                     |
| Present Model                 | 15 mins| Present model CVs and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Students work in pairs to evaluate two different CVs provided in handouts. Each pair identifies successful attributes and areas needing improvement. Afterward, conduct a plenary session allowing pairs to present their findings. **Scaffolding:** Provide a checklist highlighting key features of a good CV, such as clarity, grammatical accuracy, and the relevance of information presented. This structured analysis will enhance comprehension.                                                                                                                | Limit teacher talk; facilitate student discovery. Allow students to explore and infer effective practices through guided observation and peer sharing.                |
| Useful Language               | 15 mins| Conduct a vocabulary game: "CV Vocabulary Bingo." Provide a list of essential job-related terms and phrases used in CV writing (e.g., "achieved," "managed," "collaborated"). Students fill a bingo card with these words. Call out definitions, and students mark matching words on their cards. The first to complete a line shouts "Bingo!" **Scaffolding:** Pre-teach difficult vocabulary with images and definitions. Use repetition and provide example sentences. Formative assessment through a quick check on understanding immediately follows each round.                                                                                                             | This game activates student interest and ensures active participation. Quick checks for understanding maintain engagement and assert learning comprehension.          |
| Preparation                   | 15 mins| Allow students to brainstorm and note down their personal achievements, skills, and experiences for their own CVs. This is an individual task followed by peer review in pairs where they provide feedback. **Scaffolding:** Use graphic organizers for listing skills and experiences. Supply templates for students to fill in their information based on the components discussed earlier. Conduct an assessment checkpoint by asking pairs to share standout achievements or particularly effective expressions found in their partner’s CV.                                                                                                       | Encourage peer interaction and constructive critique. Break down the process of self-reflection, helping students articulate their achievements systematically.         |
| Complete Task                 | 35 mins| Students create a CV draft using either digital tools or handwritten entries. Emphasize articulating professional experiences using present and past perfect tenses. Once drafts are completed, students practice presenting their CV highlights in pairs, simulating an interview context. They ask each other interview-style questions based on the CV, promoting vocal articulation of personal strengths and experiences. **Scaffolding:** Offer sentence starters such as "I have worked on...", "I achieved...", and examples to assist. Conduct regular checks, offering guidance and corrections as needed.                                                                                   | Encourage the use of complete sentences during presentations. Aim to cultivate a supportive environment where students are confident articulating personal achievements.|
| Feedback/Error Correction     | 15 mins| Provide constructive feedback focusing on both written and spoken aspects observed during the task. Use examples from student CVs to suggest improvements. Highlight successful language use and provide strategies for better articulation. Encourage peer feedback to enhance collaborative learning and self-reflection on performance. **Scaffolding:** Use a rubric to structure feedback, including categories for language accuracy, completeness, and presentation skills. This can then be used by students for peer assessment and self-evaluation.                                                                                                                                                                       | Balance positive feedback with gentle corrections. Foster a classroom culture of encouragement, aiming to build confidence by reinforcing existing strengths.           |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)   | 5 mins | Address emergent questions or allow students additional time to refine their CV drafts. Offer one-on-one support and clarification where necessary. **Scaffolding:** Provide additional examples or clarify concepts misunderstood by students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Use this time flexibly, based on student needs. Help individual learners struggling with specific areas identified in earlier assessment checkpoints.                  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing more support during peer activities. Provide additional examples and personalized guidance as needed. Use empathy and be sensitive to varying comfort levels with personal disclosure.
- **Classroom Management:** Encourage respect for each other's experiences and confidentiality, especially during sensitive discussions about personal achievements and career goals.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with under- or over-emphasizing achievements. Guide them to maintain balance with realistic portrayals.
