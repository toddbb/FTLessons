### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                             | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                        | 10 mins| Begin with a quick icebreaker game called "Find Someone Who". Students circulate, asking peers questions to complete a checklist of traits or experiences (e.g., find someone who has a unique hobby). This not only warms up their language skills but also encourages initial interactions, creating a friendly atmosphere. Use a checklist with prompts to guide questions, ensuring students engage. Provide sentence starters and monitor their use of questions. Teacher circulates to assist and model if needed, minimizing direct instruction and promoting student discovery of language through interaction. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**         | 10 mins| Display images of various social settings (e.g., a party, a business meeting). Ask students to discuss what they see and how people might interact in each setting. Use guided questions: "What are they doing?" "How do they know each other?" This activates prior knowledge and sets the stage for discussing networking. Encourage pair discussions, allowing ideas to emerge collaboratively. Use visual aids to scaffold understanding and check for comprehension through short questions. |
| **Present Model**                 | 15 mins| Play (or read) a scripted dialogue of a networking event. Provide students with a task to identify phrases used for introducing oneself and others. After listening, discuss as a whole class the phrases identified. Highlight structures, intonation, and stress patterns used in introductions. Offer examples and encourage students to note down useful expressions. Reinforce learning through short, formative assessment questions aimed at checking comprehension and phrase recognition. Ensure scaffolding with the provision of printed scripts and annotations. |
| **Useful Language**               | 15 mins| Conduct a "Phrase Bingo" game. Give students bingo cards with common networking phrases. Read phrases out loud in random order; students mark them on their cards. First to get a line wins. This gamified approach aids memorization through repetition in an engaging format. Provide visual aids on the board, modeling pronunciation. Ensure all students can pronounce phrases correctly, integrating peer support by having students practice phrases with a partner. Use formative feedback to adjust speed and difficulty. |
| **Preparation**                   | 15 mins| Organize students into small groups and provide them with role-play scenarios on socializing and networking (e.g., meeting new classmates, attending a family event). Students plan how they would introduce themselves and interact. Teacher circulates to provide language support, using question prompts and graphic organizers. Encourage students to plan both their dialogues and potential answers, preparing them for dynamic interaction. This preparation is guided with clear language scaffolding and peer feedback mechanisms. |
| **Complete Task**                 | 35 mins| Students perform role-plays in their groups, acting out their scenarios. Encourage them to be spontaneous and natural, building fluency. Observers take notes on effective language use and interaction strategies. Rotate roles to ensure all students participate in different contexts. Teacher provides formative feedback during and after each role-play, focusing on positive reinforcement while offering corrective guidance subtly. Employ self-evaluation by having students reflect on their performance, fostering a high engagement level with minimal teacher talk. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**     | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session, highlighting successful language use and areas needing improvement. Use anonymized examples from student performances to discuss common errors. Encourage peer feedback in positive terms. Provide corrective language models and drills for common issues. Summarize key learning points and encourage reflection on personal language growth. Offer sentence stems for peer feedback to support students’ articulation of constructive critique. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**              | 5 mins | Address any emergent needs or questions from the session. Use this time for quick revision games if needed or to cover some extra vocabulary not dealt with earlier. This buffer ensures all student concerns are addressed. Encourage open questions and foster an inclusive atmosphere for final clarifications. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer sentence starters or additional graphic organizers for students needing extra support. Use peer pairing strategically based on ability levels to encourage peer teaching.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with intonation in questions. Model and provide plenty of practice with phonetic support.
- **Classroom Management:** Use clear signals for transitions between activities, and maintain dynamic but controlled environment fostering student interaction.
