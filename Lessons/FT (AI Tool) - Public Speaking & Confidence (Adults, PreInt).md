## Lesson Procedures

| Stage                          | Timing  | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Instruction Tips |
|--------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Warmer**                     | 10 mins | Begin with a quick game called “Two Truths and a Lie.” Students form small groups and each participant shares two true statements and one falsehood about their public speaking experiences. The group guesses which statement is false, promoting relaxed interaction. This activity lowers anxiety and builds rapport in a fun way. | Encourage casual chatting to reduce stress and set a friendly tone. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**      | 10 mins | Use a short video clip of an inspiring TED Talk to set context. Ask students to identify what makes the speaker effective. Guide a brief discussion on comfort, clarity, and the importance of confident speaking, using scaffolded questions. This interaction will contextualize the importance of public speaking skills.                   | Choose a clip about 3 minutes long. Ask specific questions to lead the discussion effectively. |
| **Present Model**              | 15 mins | Display a short, well-structured speech using slides with key phrases highlighted. Students work in pairs to identify persuasive techniques and confidence markers (e.g., body language, tone). Provide sentence starters on the board to support analysis. Use the think-pair-share strategy to facilitate discussion before sharing as a class.   | Encourage observation of non-verbal cues. Keep teacher talk to a minimum by prompting students to share insights. |
| **Useful Language (Game-Based)** | 15 mins | Play “Persuasion Bingo.” Create bingo cards with persuasive phrases and vocabulary. As you read a mock speech, students mark phrases they hear. This activity reinforces vocabulary and listening skills in an engaging format. After the game, debrief with students, asking which phrases were most effective and why.                | Adjust the speech's difficulty according to student ability. Encourage peer support by having students help each other during the game. |
| **Preparation**                | 15 mins | Students select a topic related to personal success or a motivational theme. Provide a graphic organizer to aid in structuring their speech (introduction, main points, conclusion). In groups, students plan their speeches, offering each other feedback. Monitor discussions to ensure that language accuracy is maintained while fostering creativity. | Scaffold planning by supplying sample structures and prompts. Check progress and offer assistance where necessary. |
| **Complete Task**              | 35 mins | Students present their speeches to small groups. Encourage use of confident posture, clear articulation, and persuasive language. Peers listen actively and note down effective techniques and areas for improvement. Provide a formative assessment sheet to gather feedback, ensuring comprehensive peer interaction and peer support.                | Limit teacher intervention; act as a facilitator rather than a critic. Offer positive reinforcement and guidance as needed. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**  | 15 mins | Conduct a whole class feedback session. Highlight common strengths and areas of improvement observed during speeches. Use examples from student speeches to model improvements. Encourage self-assessment and peer feedback using structured reflection sheets. This will help reinforce confidence and skills accuracy.                          | Use anonymous examples to maintain comfort. Foster a supportive atmosphere to encourage constructive feedback. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**           | 5 mins  | Allow time for any immediate questions, addressing emergent language needs or wrapping up discussions on confidence-building techniques. Use this time to cover any unforeseen questions or reinforce vocabulary. Ensure students leave with a positive understanding of their progress and improvements to work on.                                | This is optional but valuable for addressing real-time issues. Offer additional resources for eager learners. |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies**: Use visual aids and sentence frames for students needing additional support. Encourage stronger students to challenge themselves with advanced vocabulary and complex structures.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure students do not become overly focused on perfection, which may inhibit fluency. Keep the focus on communicative effectiveness over grammatical accuracy.
- **Classroom Management**: Monitor group dynamics during peer activities to ensure inclusive participation.
