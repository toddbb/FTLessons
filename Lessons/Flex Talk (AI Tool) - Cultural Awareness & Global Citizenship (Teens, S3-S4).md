| Stage                    | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Instruction Tips                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                   | 10 mins| The lesson begins with a quick "Cultural Snap" activity. Display images of cultural symbols (e.g., the Eiffel Tower for France, sushi for Japan) around the room. Students walk around, identifying and matching the images with the correct countries. This activity builds interest and activates prior knowledge. As students circulate, they discuss with peers, guessing country names and sharing any personal connections to the places. The teacher facilitates by providing hints or fun facts about each symbol. This encourages interaction and sets a dynamic tone for the lesson.                              | Use visual prompts to aid understanding. Encourage students to speak in English. |
| Lead-In / Set Context    | 10 mins| Introduce the topic of "Cultural Awareness & Global Citizenship" with a short story about a traveler visiting multiple countries and learning about different cultures. Teachers read the story, pausing to ask students prediction questions and encouraging them to relate the story to personal experiences of encountering new cultures. Use a world map to point out the locations mentioned in the story. Scaffold with sentence starters like “In my culture, we...”. This stage engages students and prompts them to think about their own cultural experiences and values in a global context.                                   | Maintain a brisk pace to keep energy high. Use gestures to enhance comprehension. |
| Present Model            | 15 mins| Present a dialogue between two friends discussing global citizenship, using a pre-recorded audio or role-play. Students listen and identify key phrases related to cultural awareness and responsibility. Distribute the dialogue transcript with blanks for missing phrases. Students work in pairs to fill in the missing parts based on what they hear. This reinforces listening skills and introduces useful expressions naturally. After listening twice, students compare answers with peers, fostering collaboration and peer learning.                                                                                   | Conduct comprehension checks by asking targeted questions. Model unclear parts.   |
| Useful Language          | 15 mins| Conduct a role-play game called “Cultural Exchange”. Divide students into pairs, assigning each a card representing a culture. Each card includes basic facts and a cultural tradition. Students take turns acting as cultural ambassadors, using sentence starters to explain their culture’s traditions. For instance, "In ____, we celebrate __ by ____". Emphasize the use of present simple tense for consistency. Students ask questions to learn more about their partner’s culture, adding a layer of interaction and curiosity. The game encourages the use of target language in a playful and engaging way.             | Encourage creativity and the use of English-only during role-plays.               |
| Preparation              | 15 mins| Students prepare a short presentation about a global issue relevant to young people (e.g., climate change, online safety). Provide graphic organizers to help structure ideas. They use vocabulary from the lesson and personal examples to build their narrative. The teacher circulates, offering assistance and feedback on language accuracy. This stage allows for scaffolded practice as students organize thoughts and rehearse language structures. Provide additional resources, such as word banks, and sentence frames like “A global issue we face today is…”. This preparation fosters deeper engagement with the topic.                 | Guide students on using organizers effectively. Check in with quiet students.     |
| Complete Task            | 35 mins| Conduct "Global Citizens Forum" where students present their topics. Divide the class into small groups, allowing each student time to speak. Encourage active listening through a peer feedback system: listeners note one thing they learned and one question they have about each presentation. This stage prioritizes communication and fluency over accuracy, supporting students as they express their ideas and opinions. After each presentation, the group has a quick discussion, answering questions and giving feedback. This interactive platform builds confidence and emphasizes the lesson’s communicative goals.                    | Facilitate group discussions by prompting with questions. Balance group sizes.    |
| Feedback/Error Correction| 15 mins| Use student presentations as a basis for feedback on common language errors. Highlight examples of effective communication and correct mistakes gently. Employ positive reinforcement, emphasizing students’ strengths and achievements. Use a class whiteboard to collectively address recurrent pronunciation issues and grammar slips, allowing students to self-correct with guidance. This is a reflective stage aimed at constructive improvement rather than criticism. Encourage students to reflect on their learning on a personal level, asking what they enjoyed or found challenging.                                       | Be supportive and constructive. Focus on recurring errors for group learning.    |
| Flex-time/Buffer         | 5 mins | Allocate this time for addressing any last-minute questions or providing additional practice as needed. Flex-time allows the teacher to address emergent language needs or clarify misunderstandings, offering a personalized end to the session. If time allows, engage students in a quick wrap-up game, revisiting vocabulary or key expressions through a short quiz. This ensures retention and consolidates learning in a relaxed, friendly way.                                                                                                                                                                         | Adapt to student needs. Use this time creatively for review or questions.        |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiate tasks by providing more extended support for lower-level students through sentence starters and visual aids.
- Monitor groups closely during activities, offering real-time feedback and support.
- Encourage high student energy and interaction to minimize teacher talk and maximize student output.
