| Stage                     | Timing  | Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                    | 10 mins | Begin with a quick icebreaker where students line up in order of how busy they think their day is, from busiest to least busy. Once lined up, have them discuss in pairs their reasons for placing themselves at that point and one tip they personally use for managing their tasks. This activates prior knowledge and sets a collaborative tone.                                                                                   | Encourage students to explain their reasons clearly, offering sentence starters for those who need it: "I placed myself here because..." Ensure students switch partners to promote a dynamic class. |
| Lead-In / Set Context     | 10 mins | Show a short video or presentation clip about common time management challenges. After viewing, conduct a class discussion where students list these challenges on the board. Prompt them to consider how these challenges affect productivity. This activity engages students and introduces the topic clearly.                                                                                                             | Use visual aids and key vocabulary on the board to assist understanding. Allow students to express personal experiences related to the video content to connect it back to them.                     |
| Present Model             | 15 mins | Present a dialogue between two friends discussing how they manage their time for a project. Have students identify and underline useful expressions related to giving advice and managing time. Then, script out essential expressions on the board, discussing their usage. This task gives the target language context.                                                                                                 | Use role-play to engage students, encouraging them to practice the dialogue with varying intonation for fluency development. Ask comprehension questions to ensure understanding.                   |
| Useful Language           | 15 mins | Play "Vocabulary Charades": Divide the class into small groups. Each group picks a vocabulary card with words like "deadline" and "multitask" and acts it out for the others to guess. This activity is energetic and supports vocabulary retention. After, discuss how each word connects to time management.                                                                                       | Prompt students to think creatively about how to portray abstract concepts physically. Emphasize pronunciation and form during the post-activity discussion.                                         |
| Preparation               | 15 mins | In pairs, students prepare a short role-play where one student is a consultant giving advice to another student struggling with time management. Use a handout to guide phrases and key vocabulary. This provides structured practice before the main task.                                                                                                                                                               | Offer examples and assist in brainstorming ideas. Facilitate by circulating and giving feedback, suggesting vocabulary or phrases as needed.                                                        |
| Complete Task             | 35 mins | Have pairs perform their role-plays to the class. Encourage active listening by having the audience note down key pieces of advice given. After each role-play, the audience can offer additional tips or advice. This builds fluency and provides collaborative learning through peer feedback.                                                                                                                   | Limit teacher talk to guidance, allowing students to interact and help each other improve. Offer feedback constructively and facilitate discussions on the role-plays.                                |
| Feedback/Error Correction | 15 mins | Provide feedback focusing on accuracy, fluency, and use of target language. Use anonymous samples of errors from the role-play to avoid singling out students. Praise effective use of vocabulary and correct common errors as a class. Finally, ask reflective questions about what strategies they will apply in their daily life.                                                                                              | Use the board to visually correct errors, reinforcing correct usage. Encourage peer-correction by asking students to suggest improvements to sentences.                                               |
| Flex-time/Buffer          | 5 mins  | Address any unanswered questions or allow additional practice on any challenging areas. Reinforce positive student interaction and learning from the session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Use this time to individually address any student concerns or to highlight outstanding examples of student work or participation.                                                                   |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation**: Pair stronger students with those who might need more language support. Adjust the complexity of the role-play scenarios based on the student group.
- **Classroom Management**: Encourage an open and respectful environment during feedback sessions and role-plays.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Students often struggle with conceptual language like "efficiency"—use visual examples where possible.
