|------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins | Begin with a quick icebreaker where students share one strength they bring to a team setting. This activity fosters a safe environment and encourages interaction. Have students form pairs and take turns sharing. For larger groups, a dynamic "speed dating" setup can be used where students switch partners every two minutes. This warm-up sets a positive tone and helps students feel comfortable using English right away.                                                                                                                                          | Use simple prompts to guide students. Encourage active listening.                |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins | Introduce the topic of teamwork by showing a short, engaging video highlighting effective teamwork scenarios. Pause the video at key moments to elicit predictions and personal reactions (e.g., "What do you think will happen next?" or "Have you experienced something similar?"). This makes students activate prior knowledge and provides a vivid context. Follow up with a quick round of group discussions on what makes teamwork successful, focusing on keywords from the video. Provide visuals or mind maps to support discussions.  | Use open-ended questions to promote engagement.                                  |
| Present Model                | 15 mins | Present a model dialogue featuring typical teamwork scenarios. Organize a role-play where two students act out the dialogue, appropriately using target language and functional language like modals (e.g., "We might consider..."). As students listen, encourage them to jot down useful phrases and vocabulary. Guide them to focus on stress patterns and intonation during suggestions. Allocate time for students to practice the dialogue in pairs afterward. Circulate to provide support and check comprehension.                                               | Highlight pronunciation of key phrases. Use visual aids for vocabulary.         |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins | Conduct a game-based vocabulary activity called "Teamwork Bingo." Provide each student with a bingo card containing teamwork-related vocabulary. Call out definitions or example sentences and have students cross off the corresponding words. The first few students to get a 'Bingo' must explain the words they have crossed off. This encourages students to listen attentively and engage with the vocabulary in a competitive and fun way.                                                                                                                                        | Ensure all students understand the rules. Repeat definitions slowly and clearly.  |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins | Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a simulated team task (e.g., planning an event, solving a problem). Provide a list of potential issues and vocabulary sheets related to teamwork. Each group must discuss how to approach the task using the target language, focusing on making suggestions and solving problems. Encourage them to assign roles and use graphic organizers to plan their discussion. Regularly check with groups, providing scaffolding where necessary and facilitating peer support.                                  | Offer guidance as needed, but allow groups to lead their own interactions.       |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins | Have groups present their ideas and strategies to the class, followed by a Q&A session where other groups ask questions or offer suggestions. Encourage a collaborative atmosphere where feedback is constructive, allowing groups to refine their strategies and language use. Throughout the presentations, take notes on positive language use and areas for improvement. This session is student-centered, emphasizing spontaneous, meaningful conversations and interactions.                                                        | Foster an environment of mutual respect and active participation.               |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins | Lead a feedback session where you share observations from the task, emphasizing both strengths and common errors. Use student examples where possible, facilitating peer correction. Focus on language related to agreement/disagreement and effective suggestions. Provide corrective feedback and highlight strategic use of teamwork vocabulary. Encourage students to reflect on their own performance and consider areas for improvement. Foster self-assessment by asking reflective questions.                                        | Maintain positivity. Focus on both language accuracy and communicative skill.     |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)  | 5 mins  | Use this time to address any remaining questions or provide additional practice on concepts that seemed challenging. Consider extending successful activities or integrating spontaneous topics of interest that arose during the lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Be adaptive to student needs, ensuring continuous engagement.                     |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Offer personalized support to students requiring additional assistance and challenge those who grasp concepts quickly.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with using modals correctly; provide additional practice as needed. Monitor for understanding.
- **Classroom Management:** Establish clear guidelines for peer feedback and discussion participation to maintain a supportive learning environment.
