| Warmer                         | 10 min | The lesson begins with a group brainstorming session where students discuss recent trips they have taken or dream destinations they want to visit. This activity is designed to spark interest and provide a safe space for students to share their experiences. Each student will take a turn speaking, encouraging active listening from their peers. The teacher will move around to offer prompts or vocabulary support, but the focus remains on student interaction. The aim is to create a positive atmosphere and to activate background knowledge.                                           | Encourage all students to participate. Provide sentence starters like, "One place I dream of visiting is..." to support reluctant speakers.                                                   |
| Lead-In / Set Context          | 10 min | Using travel brochures and maps, students will work in pairs to discuss different travel destinations. Pairs will choose one destination and list activities they would likely do there. The teacher will circulate, offering scaffolded questions and vocabulary prompts. This part of the lesson serves to immerse students in the theme of travel and will guide them into thinking about the practicalities of navigating new places. Visual aids will be provided to support vocabulary comprehension.                                                             | Emphasize the use of target vocabulary by introducing and pointing out several terms on the brochures. Adapt difficulty based on pair proficiency levels.                                     |
| Present Model                  | 15 min | Students listen to two short audio clips of conversations: one about booking a hotel, and the other about asking for directions in a foreign city. After listening, students are asked to identify key phrases used in each scenario. In pairs, they match these phrases on the board with their function (e.g., question, request, clarification). This comprehension task ensures understanding of the target language structures. Afterward, select pairs share their findings with the class to facilitate broader discussion and reinforce the learning.               | Use audio clips with clear speech. Pause after key phrases to check comprehension. Provide a worksheet with the transcript for students to annotate during listening.                        |
| Useful Language                | 15 min | In this interactive game-based activity, students play "Travel Phrase Bingo" using a bingo card filled with useful travel phrases (e.g., “Could you recommend...?”, “How far is...?”). The teacher calls out scenarios, and students must identify and cover the phrase that would fit it. The first student to complete a row shouts "Bingo" and explains their phrases in context, reinforcing practical application. This activity reinforces retention and quick recall of travel-related language essential for real-life interaction.                                     | Use lively pacing to maintain energy. Provide feedback after each phrase and context scenario. Ensure a diverse range of phrases on bingo cards to cover different travel situations.        |
| Preparation                    | 15 min | Students will engage in a role-play preparation based on a set travel scenario, such as navigating through an airport or booking a local tour. Pairs are given time to plan their dialogue using guiding questions and sentence starters. They use the provided vocabulary list to draft role-plays in their notebooks. This planning phase is crucial for balancing accuracy and spontaneity in the main task. Support will be available, monitoring pairs to offer feedback as needed.                                                                                            | Circulate and offer language points or corrections subtly while students plan their dialogues. Encourage all pairs to share their scenario with at least one other pair for peer feedback.    |
| Complete Task                  | 35 min | Students perform their prepared role-plays in front of the class. Different pairs present various scenarios to ensure a wide range of travel contexts are covered. After each performance, classmates are encouraged to ask questions or suggest alternative responses. While students present, the teacher takes notes for later feedback. This task focuses on fluency, interaction, and spontaneous language use, mirroring real-life travel situations and promoting confidence in authentic communication.                                                  | Encourage positive feedback and constructive criticism from peers after each role-play. Highlight good usage of target language during or after performances to encourage student success.    |
| Feedback/Error Correction      | 15 min | The teacher provides feedback based on notes taken during presentations. Focus on pronunciation, sentence structure, and appropriate expressions. Specific examples from student performances are used to illustrate points. This is followed by a brief error correction session where common mistakes are reviewed and correct versions practiced. The aim is to consolidate learning and enhance language accuracy alongside fluency.                                                                                                        | Use positive reinforcement consistently and highlight areas of improvement in a supportive manner. Encourage students to self-correct and peer-correct during this session.                   |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)    | 5 min  | Open floor for any remaining questions or clarifications needed. Alternatively, present additional phrases or cultural insights related to travel. Flex-time is designed to address emergent student needs, providing a more tailored learning experience based on student interests or difficulties that arose during the lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Use this time for individualized support or advanced vocabulary/idioms for stronger students. Adapt based on class needs ensuring all leave the class with clear takeaways from the lesson. |

**Teacher Notes and Tips:**  
- Differentiation strategies should include providing extra vocabulary support for weaker students and extra challenging role-play scenarios for stronger ones.
- Anticipate that students may struggle with pronunciation; consider providing IPA transcriptions.
- Use classroom management techniques to ensure active listening and respect during peer presentations.
