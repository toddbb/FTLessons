| Stage                        | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Instruction Tips                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Start by playing a short audio recording of a casual conversation in a café. Ask students to identify specific elements, like the setting and mood, from the recording. This task will engage them and set a relaxed environment. Model active listening strategies and encourage students to share their initial thoughts and predictions about the conversation. This activity establishes a friendly atmosphere and primes their focus on everyday dialogues.                                                                                                                                                 | Encourage students to pay attention to tone and context. Use prompts to support any hesitant students.                       |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Discuss the importance of everyday communication in enhancing fluency and natural usage of English. Elicit students’ experiences with daily interactions in English-speaking contexts. Use examples that highlight successful conversational exchanges and have students share obstacles they have encountered. Create a mind map on the board that categorizes topics typically found in everyday conversations (e.g., weather, hobbies, directions). Through these shared insights, build a collective understanding of the day's focus and stimulate motivation by highlighting real-world applications.                           | Use open-ended questions to elicit responses. Visual aids can support understanding for visual learners.                     |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Distribute a conversation transcript filled with blanks. Play a role-playing video illustrating a typical social interaction. Students must fill in the gaps as they watch. After viewing, discuss the context, key phrases, and why certain language was used. Model correct pronunciation and intonation, emphasizing how these affect understanding. Allow students to role-play sections of the dialogue in pairs while providing corrective feedback. This activity promotes inductive learning, supporting students as they engage directly with authentic language use.                                                        | Pause the video at strategic points to check comprehension. Encourage peer correction and rehearsal in pairs.                |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Implement a game-based activity called "Phrase Match-Up." Provide students with sets of cards showing incomplete phrases and their corresponding completions. Students work in small groups to find the matches, discussing the potential usage scenarios of each phrase. Offer guidance as they identify correct matches and explore variations or synonyms. For added challenge, introduce a timer to encourage quick thinking, fostering a lively and engaging atmosphere. Conclude with a class discussion to confirm answers and clarify any misunderstandings. Scaffold the activity with sentence starters displayed on the board. | Monitor group discussions for supportive feedback. Use visuals to reinforce newly learned phrases.                           |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| Assign each group a specific scenario (e.g., asking for directions, ordering in a café) to plan a short role-play. Provide graphic organizers to help students structure their dialogues and relevant vocabulary from prior activities. Circulate the room, offering guidance and supporting language choices. Emphasize the significance of incorporating previously learned vocabulary and communication strategies to enhance confidence in actual interaction. Use formative assessment techniques to evaluate students' plans, such as quick check-ins or thumbs-up/thumbs-down comprehension checks.                                                             | Encourage students to visualize real-life applications. Foster collaboration by having groups share ideas with each other.    |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Engage students in the "Interactive Role-Play Theatre," where they perform their planned scenarios. Each group will role-play in front of the class, while the audience provides constructive feedback based on clarity, vocabulary usage, and pronunciation. Rotate roles to ensure equal participation. Use a "Feedback Sandwich" approach: highlight positives, suggest improvements, and end on a positive note. Integrate a peer evaluation component where students assess in a structured form, focusing on specific criteria. Through this exercise, learners practice spontaneous speaking, building fluency and confidence progressively. | Create an encouraging environment, stressing growth and learning over perfection. Use realia to enhance authenticity in scenarios. |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins| Initiate a class discussion reflecting on the role-play performances. Highlight common strengths and address recurring issues, such as mispronunciations or language misuse. Provide explicit examples of improved phraseology or sentence structures. Offer corrective feedback seamlessly integrated into supportive commentary. Utilize error correction signs to make corrections visual, integrating gestures as necessary for common errors. Encourage self-reflection by having students note personal speaking goals and improvements since the beginning of the lesson.                                           | Maintain a reassuring tone, emphasizing growth. Encourage self-assessment for personal goal setting and reflection.           |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)  | 5 mins | Use this time to address any remaining questions or to review problematic areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Preparation is key; anticipate potential areas needing reinforcement.                                                        |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiation Strategies: Pair stronger students with peers needing support. Use differentiated tasks to cater to varied proficiency levels within the range.
- Common Pitfalls: Monitor for over-reliance on memorized phrases without understanding context. Reinforce flexibility and adaptability in phrase usage.
- Classroom Management: Ensure equitable participation; use a speaking stick or equivalent to manage turn-taking effectively.
