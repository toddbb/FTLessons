### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Extensive Activity Description                                                                          | Instruction Tips                                       |
|------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                   | 10 mins | Begin with a game called "Health Charades." Students take turns acting out health and fitness activities (e.g., jogging, yoga, eating vegetables) while classmates guess. This will energize the class and introduce key vocabulary playfully. Use flashcards to pre-teach actions.  | Demonstrate an example to ensure understanding. Encourage students to use gestures.           |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**    | 10 mins | Show a series of images related to health and well-being (use projector). Ask students to discuss what they see and how each image relates to health. This will activate prior knowledge and engage students with the topic. Use guiding questions: "What do you think this is about?" "How can this be good for you?"  | Encourage partner discussions and prompt with questions. Provide visual vocabulary support.    |
| **Present Model**            | 15 mins | Play a short video clip where people discuss their health and fitness routines. Give students a listening task to identify specific words and phrases about health. After watching, play the clip again and ask students to note down any new words they hear. Review these words as a class, focusing on pronunciation and meaning. Ensure students have a clear task to motivate focused listening. | Highlight key phrases and repeat them for emphasis. Model pronunciation clearly.               |
| **Useful Language**          | 15 mins | Engage students in a vocabulary bingo game. Hand out bingo cards with new health-related vocabulary. Call out definitions while students mark the appropriate words on their cards. The first to complete a line shouts "Bingo!" This will help reinforce vocabulary knowledge through a fun, competitive activity. | Use word cards to pre-teach vocabulary. Encourage students to read aloud sentences for practice. |
| **Preparation**              | 15 mins | In pairs, have students prepare short dialogues about their health routines using target vocabulary. Provide sentence starters and visual aids. For instance, "I like to…" "My favorite exercise is…" Circulate and offer guidance to ensure accuracy and confidence. Provide graphic organizers to structure thoughts. | Monitor pairs, offering feedback. Encourage students to expand ideas with sentence frames.       |
| **Complete Task**            | 35 mins | Have students perform role-plays based on their dialogues. Encourage them to ask questions about each other's routines. Allow time for practice before presentations. This provides an authentic context for language use and allows students to practice fluency. Use peer support frameworks to build confidence. | Facilitate peer feedback, encouraging positive reinforcement. Use formative assessments to check understanding. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**| 15 mins | After presentations, provide constructive feedback highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Focus on accuracy and fluency, and clarify any misunderstandings. Use examples from student dialogues. Reinforce correct usage with additional practice if necessary. | Conduct a class feedback session. Use visual aids to correct common errors.                     |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**         | 5 mins  | Address any additional questions or clarifications needed. This time can also be used to review vocabulary or practice pronunciation further if needed. | Adapt activities based on students' needs in real-time.                                          |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Encourage a supportive environment where students feel comfortable expressing opinions.
- Use differentiation strategies to support varying skill levels, such as more visual aids for struggling students.
- Be prepared for common pitfalls, such as pronunciation challenges, by modeling frequently.
- Maintain a high energy level to keep students engaged through interactive activities.
