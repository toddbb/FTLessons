### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                         | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Warmer                        | 10 mins| Begin with a quick interactive activity called "Agree/Disagree Corners." Set up the classroom with two corners labeled "Agree" and "Disagree." Call out statements related to current events or preferences (e.g., "Reading is more enjoyable than watching movies.") and have students move to the corner that represents their viewpoint. Encourage a few students to briefly explain their positioning. This activity energizes students and introduces the concept of holding and justifying opinions. Use this time to assess students' current ability to express their thoughts.|
| Lead-In / Set Context         | 10 mins| Introduce the lesson topic: "Debate & Constructive Argumentation." Discuss with students what they think makes a good debate and why debating can be a valuable skill. Display a short online clip from a debate show, focusing on the style rather than content. Ask students to note down any persuasive language or strategies they observe. Afterward, engage students in a short discussion about their observations, asking guiding questions to hone in on persuasive techniques seen.|
| Present Model                 | 15 mins| Present students with an example argument from the handout. Model how to construct a basic argument using this example, emphasizing structure: introduction, supporting points, and conclusion. Highlight the use of modals and debate vocabulary. Provide a clear task: identify and underline key persuasive phrases in the provided model. This guided task ensures students recognize components of argumentation and builds a foundation for the next activities. Incorporate a peer-check segment where students compare findings with a partner.|
| Useful Language               | 15 mins| Conduct a game-based activity called "Vocabulary Match-Up." Provide students with cards containing debate-related vocabulary and definitions. In pairs, students must match each word to its definition. This activity accelerates vocabulary retention through peer interaction and game mechanics. Conclude with a group discussion to review answers, encouraging peer teaching and correction. Use formative questions to check for understanding, ensuring students are familiar with their use. |
| Preparation                   | 15 mins| Divide students into small groups and assign each a debate topic from the handout. Allow time for students to brainstorm and develop their arguments and counterarguments. Provide sentence starters and prompts (e.g., "One reason is...", "An important point to consider...") on the board to support students in formulating their points. Circulate the room providing guidance and feedback, addressing any questions and using mini-checkpoints to check student readiness for the debate. |
| Complete Task                 | 35 mins| Facilitate the debate sessions. Each group presents their arguments and counterarguments in a structured format. Ensure equal speaking time and encourage active listening and respectful disagreement. Use a digital timer to keep time. Observe interactions and take notes for feedback. Encourage peers to ask questions or provide supportive comments after presentations to foster a collaborative environment. The goal is for students to practice fluency and persuasive speaking in a controlled setting. Minimize teacher talk by acting as a facilitator rather than a direct participant.|
| Feedback / Error Correction   | 15 mins| Provide collective feedback focusing on both language use and debate structure. Highlight strong performances and key areas for improvement using examples from the debates observed. Conduct a brief error correction session, focusing on recurrent issues, especially with modals and vocabulary. Encourage self-correction and peer feedback to reinforce learning. If time permits, allow students to practice corrected phrases in pairs. |
| Flex-time / Buffer            | 5 mins | Use this time to address any questions or revisit any aspect of the lesson needing reinforcement. Optional quick follow-up activity: have students write a short reflection on what they learned about debating. This can serve as a formative assessment to gauge understanding and inform future teaching. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation**: Provide additional support to students who need it by pairing them with stronger partners during preparation and debates. Use visual aids and examples for those struggling with abstract concepts.
- **Pitfalls**: Be aware that some students may dominate discussions; encourage balanced participation.
- **Classroom management**: Maintain an encouraging atmosphere, emphasizing respect and listening skills during debates.

#### Model Argument

**Topic**: "School uniforms should be mandatory."

**Introduction**: I firmly believe that school uniforms should be mandatory for all students.

**Supporting Points**:
1. **Equality**: Uniforms create a sense of equality among students, reducing peer pressure.
2. **Focus**: With uniforms, students can focus more on their studies rather than on their clothes.

**Conclusion**: Therefore, making school uniforms mandatory is a step towards creating a more focused and fair educational environment.
