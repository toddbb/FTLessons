| **Stage**                 | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                | 10 mins    | Begin with a dynamic game called "Word Splash." Display a large sheet of paper with the word "Green Technology" in the center. Around it, students will brainstorm in pairs, writing any words or ideas that come to mind related to the term. This activity engages students, activating their background knowledge and sparking interest. Swap papers between pairs and have them add more ideas to each other's sheets. The teacher should circulate, providing prompts if necessary and encouraging students to orally share interesting points. Conclude by eliciting a few ideas from the class, ensuring active participation.                                    |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins    | Show a short video showcasing various sustainable innovations, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or electric cars. As students watch, instruct them to jot down two innovations and one benefit of each. After viewing, facilitate a brief discussion in small groups about the video, using guiding questions: “What did you see?” “How do these innovations help the environment?” The teacher should monitor the conversations, offering corrective feedback when needed. This stage sets the context by connecting visual understanding to the targeted topic, prompting students to think critically and discuss confidently.                         |
| **Present Model**         | 15 mins    | Introduce model dialogues focused on describing green technologies using images from the video. Display sentences highlighting present simple tense and modal verbs (e.g., "Solar panels convert sunlight into energy. We should use them to save electricity."). Engage students by assigning roles in pairs to practice these dialogues, modeling first as the teacher. Provide sentence starters and visual aids to support their comprehension. Circulate to listen, offering scaffolding and corrective feedback to ensure students understand the language structures. This stage prioritizes interactive learning, allowing students to practice target phrases actively. |
| **Useful Language**       | 15 mins    | Implement a game-based activity called "Green Technology Bingo." Distribute bingo cards with vocabulary words, such as "solar panel," "recycle," "eco-friendly," etc. Read definitions or use them in sentences, and students mark them on their cards. The first to complete a line shouts "Bingo!" prompting a brief discussion of the words used. This activity encourages repetition and reinforces vocabulary retention in an enjoyable format, catering to younger learners. Ensure various rounds to practice a range of vocabulary, providing peer support with pairs checking each other's understanding.                                                    |
| **Preparation**           | 15 mins    | Allow students to work in small groups to prepare a short presentation on an assigned green technology, using the vocabulary and structures learned. They should use a graphic organizer to outline key points and practice their delivery. Scaffold by providing sentence starters and a list of useful phrases. Offer guidance and feedback as they organize their thoughts. This preparation time ensures that students can articulate their ideas coherently and confidently, focusing on both accuracy and fluency while gradually moving towards independent production.                                                                                        |
| **Complete Task**         | 35 mins    | Students present their projects to the class, describing their chosen technology and its environmental benefits. Encourage peers to ask questions and give constructive feedback. Ensure a supportive environment by setting clear rules for respectful listening and commentary. This stage enhances student interaction, enabling spontaneous and meaningful communication. Prompt additional conversations related to ideas presented, encouraging further engagement. This task allows students to showcase their understanding and improve their fluency in using the targeted language around sustainability topics.                                                                 |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | After presentations, facilitate a feedback session focusing on language accuracy, fluency, and delivery. Use examples from students' performances to highlight effective usage and areas for improvement. Encourage self-assessment and peer feedback, helping students reflect on their participation. Provide specific praise for correctly used language forms and guidance for common errors identified during the task. This stage consolidates learning, reinforcing correct language use while fostering a growth mindset towards continuous improvement.                                                                |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**      | 5 mins     | Use this time to address any emerging questions or revisit complex language areas students struggled with. Alternatively, organize a quick wrap-up game such as a "Vocabulary Relay" to reinforce learning, maximizing student engagement. This flexible time addresses individual learning needs, ensuring thorough understanding and retention of the target language.                                |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation:** Tailor tasks by offering sentence starters for weaker students and encouraging advanced students to use more complex structures.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Anticipate confusion over similar vocabulary items; use visual aids extensively.
- **Classroom Management:** Establish clear guidelines for group activities to ensure all students participate actively and manage noise levels effectively.
