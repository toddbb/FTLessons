### Lesson Procedures

| Stage                        | Timing | Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                       | 10 mins| Begin with a "Who Am I?" game where students write three statements about themselves (two true, one false) on a card. Students then circulate, reading their statements to peers, who guess which is false. This breaks the ice while linking to personal strengths and branding.                                                  | Model the game with your own examples. Encourage students to use complete sentences. Provide vocabulary support as needed.                                                                                     |
| Lead-In / Set Context        | 10 mins| Discuss the concept of branding using familiar logos (e.g., Nike, Apple) shown on the board. Ask students what these brands represent and why they are memorable. Shift to personal branding by relating it to how individuals can be memorable. Prompt students to discuss what makes them unique.                                            | Use visual aids to stimulate discussion. Check comprehension with questions like, "Why do you remember this brand?"                                                                                           |
| Present Model                | 15 mins| Present a short, engaging video on personal branding (available on YouTube). Give students a task to note down three tips mentioned in the video for effective personal branding. Discuss as a class what they noted.                                                                                                                                      | Pause the video for emphasis on key tips. Scaffold note-taking using a simple Listening Grid to record main points.                                                                                           |
| Useful Language              | 15 mins| Use a board game that focuses on personal branding vocabulary (attached in handouts). Students roll a die and land on squares with prompts like "Describe your strengths" or "What values represent you?" Encourage students to speak in complete sentences using target vocabulary.                                                          | Provide example sentences and sentence starters. Monitor and offer immediate feedback or corrections.                                                                                                         |
| Preparation                  | 15 mins| Pair students and have them plan a short personal presentation (1-2 minutes) about their personal brand. They should outline key strengths, values, aspirations, and experiences. Provide a graphic organizer to structure their thoughts.                                                                                                       | Offer sentence starters and a model structure for their presentation. Use peer scaffolding by allowing students to practice with their partner.                                                               |
| Complete Task                | 35 mins| Students present their personal brand to the class or in small groups. Encourage active listening by having the audience note one strength or value the speaker articulated clearly. Engage the class in providing constructive feedback focused on clarity and impact of ideas.                                                            | Rotate monitors to ensure all students take turns presenting and listening. Scaffolding can involve peers giving structured feedback using prompts like "One thing I learned about you is..."                   |
| Feedback/Error Correction    | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session where common language errors are addressed. Use positive reinforcement emphasizing the impact of articulate expression. Summarize key vocabulary and expressions related to personal branding.                                                                                                                   | Focus on both form and fluency in feedback, balancing direct correction with eliciting student self-correction.                                                                                               |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)  | 5 mins | Address any additional questions or review vocabulary as needed. Provide further resources such as relevant online platforms or videos on personal branding for interested students.                                                                                                                        | Adapt this time based on student needs, using it to address unplanned questions or emphasize important language points.                                                                                       | 

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Encourage pair work to support less confident students.
- Pay attention to equal participation in discussions to avoid dominant speakers overshadowing quieter students.
- Utilize positive reinforcement when students articulate thoughts well in English.
- Be prepared to simplify language or clarify concepts related to personal branding if needed.
