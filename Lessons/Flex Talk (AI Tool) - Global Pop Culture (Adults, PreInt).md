#### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| Stage                       | Timing | Extensive Activity Description |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                  | 10 mins| Begin with a quick chat where students share their last watched movie or show. Use a digital whiteboard to jot down the names and categorize them by type (e.g., anime, movie, series). Pre-teach vocabulary related to describing their choices, such as "genre", "plot", "character". Engage with sentence starters like "The last show I watched was...". This sets a friendly tone and prepares them to use some key vocabulary. Conduct a quick poll on the most liked type of entertainment. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**   | 10 mins| Show a short, dynamic video montage of iconic global pop culture moments. Have students watch and identify what they recognize and like. Follow with a quick group discussion, allowing each student to express their thoughts using their newly learned vocabulary. Scaffold this by offering visual aids of the video scenes and asking leading questions like "What did you find interesting?" and "Have you heard of this before?" to draw on personal experiences. |
| **Present Model**           | 15 mins| Present a model conversation on global pop culture between two speakers. Ensure the dialogue includes various trends and shows how to use present simple and present continuous. Have students listen and fill in missing words in a transcript. Follow with pair discussions where they practice pronunciation and intonation. Model first, focusing on stressing key vocabulary. Use a peer-review system where students provide feedback to each other, encouraging autonomous learning. |
| **Useful Language**         | 15 mins| Conduct a game-based activity: Pop Culture Bingo. Create cards with common slang and phrases like "fandom", "streaming", "viral". Students circulate the room asking each other questions, needing to complete their bingo cards with peers' information. Reward winners to boost motivation. Use this as a formative assessment point by observing students' fluency and accuracy, offering corrective feedback as needed. |
| **Preparation**             | 15 mins| Arrange students into small groups for a role-play on a talk show discussing the latest pop culture trend. Give each group a different trend to research briefly. Provide sentence starters and a graphic organizer to help structure their ideas. Guide them to incorporate vocabulary into their scripts, ensuring a balance between scripted accuracy and spontaneous language. Offer guidance on organizing their content logically. |
| **Complete Task**           | 35 mins| Groups present their role-plays. Encourage engagement by allowing peers to ask questions or for further explanations. This interaction builds fluency and confidence. Record presentations for later review. Use a checklist for peers to provide constructive feedback, focusing on vocabulary use, grammar accuracy, and fluency. Ensure the teacher talks minimally by only facilitating and prompting when necessary. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conclude with a feedback session, focusing on common errors observed during the presentations. Provide specific examples and illustrate corrections using visual aids. Highlight successful uses of vocabulary and structure, asking the group to suggest improvements collectively. Conclude with praise, reinforcing positive achievements and confidence in using the language. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**        | 5 mins | If time allows, run a brief Q&A session where students can ask questions or share additional thoughts on their favorite global pop culture elements. This keeps the lesson fluid and student-centered, encouraging extra practice or clarification. |

#### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation**: Pair stronger speakers with those needing more support. Use tiered vocabulary lists.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Mispronunciation of compound words. Offer targeted practice.
- **Classroom Management**: Ensure active participation by rotating group compositions.
