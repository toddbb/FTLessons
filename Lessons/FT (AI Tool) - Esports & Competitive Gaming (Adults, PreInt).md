| Warmer                      | 10 mins| Begin the lesson by asking students if they have played any video games recently. Conduct a quick survey by having students raise their hands to indicate which types of games (e.g., sports, strategy, role-playing) they prefer. Then, show a short, exciting clip from an esports tournament to capture interest. Students will then discuss in pairs what they noticed about the atmosphere and the players. Ensure each student has a moment to speak. This activity not only sets the stage for the topic but also activates prior knowledge about gaming. Encourage students to share any unique gaming experiences to foster a supportive classroom environment.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use open-ended questions to prompt discussion. Emphasize inclusion by encouraging all students to share their thoughts. Keep the video engaging and short to maintain attention.                                                                 |
| Lead-In/Set Context         | 10 mins| To activate prior knowledge, provide students with initial questions like: "What do you know about esports?" and "How do esports differ from traditional sports?" Allow students to form small groups and discuss these questions. Circulate to provide prompts and encourage elaboration. Then, regroup as a class and chart their ideas on the board, gradually building a web map to visually organize concepts like "popular games," "teams," and "tournaments." This activity enables peer collaboration while allowing students to connect the discussion to their known experiences. By setting a visual context, students can better organize their thoughts and anticipate upcoming lessons centered around esports and competitive gaming.                                                                            | Facilitate discussion by rotating among the groups and asking probing questions. Use the whiteboard to capture students' ideas effectively. Encourage students to listen actively to each other when sharing insights with the class.              |
| Present Model               | 15 mins| Introduce an infographic or set of statistics about the growth of esports globally. Have students work in pairs to analyze the data and deduce why esports is becoming so popular. Provide guiding questions like "Which regions have the largest growth?" "What are the most popular games?" and "Why do people watch or play esports?" As students work, offer sentence starters and model responses such as "Esports is popular because...", "The fastest-growing region is...", etc. Follow up with a brief class discussion, encouraging students to support their ideas with information from the infographic. This approach encourages analytical skills and forces students to transform visual data into spoken language, enhancing comprehension and oral production.                                                                                                                                                  | Provide each pair with printed infographics to allow closer analysis. Offer support through modeling before engagement to ensure clarity. Encourage thinking by prompting them to extend their answers with additional reasons or examples.         |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins| Engage students with a game-based quiz using an interactive platform like Kahoot to reinforce vocabulary. The quiz will focus on esports terminology such as "tournament," "team," "strategy," "stream," etc. As students participate, the platform's competitive element will be engaging. After the quiz, briefly discuss the correct answers, providing an opportunity for peer feedback and immediate correction. During the feedback session, have students use the new vocabulary in sentences. This game not only tests knowledge but also creates a dynamic learning experience that emphasizes retention through repeated exposure, immediate application, and peer collaboration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Ensure all students have access to technology (phones, tablets) to participate. Use energetic pacing to maintain engagement. Offer instant feedback to encourage solid understanding and correct use of vocabulary.                                    |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins| Provide students with a scenario-based task where they play roles similar to those found in an esports event, such as a commentator, player, or analyst. Have them plan a brief presentation where they describe or explain a part of an esports event using the vocabulary and language structures previously introduced. Supply students with graphic organizers to plan their roles and information flow, ensuring all roles are represented. Allow collaboration in small groups where students can brainstorm using sentence starters and comparative language structures to enhance their narrative capabilities. This planning stage strengthens both structured language practice and creative engagement while allowing students to align their interests with the language being studied.                                                                               | Use role cards to assist students in identifying their assigned roles effectively. Offer time-check reminders to ensure timely completion and encourage use of graphic organizers to stay organized and logical.                                          |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins| In the task phase, students perform their scenarios in front of peers. Before they begin, briefly model expectations by demonstrating a sample comment or analysis as the teacher. Encourage students to engage naturally, focusing on fluency and genuine interaction. Emphasize the importance of expressing opinions, making comparisons, and providing descriptions confidently. After each group performs, classmates can ask questions or provide feedback, fostering a supportive and interactive learning environment. During the task, monitor and make notes on language use to provide accurate feedback later. This phase enhances fluency, collaboration, and speaking confidence as students interact meaningfully to consolidate language and ideas.                                                                                                                                                                      | Encourage a respectful and supportive atmosphere to enhance confidence during performances. Walk around with a notebook to take notes for feedback. Use gentle cues to remind students of the vocabulary and structures discussed in class.               |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins| Provide feedback by highlighting positive language usage and areas for improvement noticed during the task. Use a mix of individual, group feedback, and peer suggestions, focusing on pronunciation, vocabulary usage, and grammar. Highlight common language patterns and correct important errors, actively engaging students by asking them to self-correct if possible. Offer oral feedback but reinforce it with written examples on the board, ensuring students have a visual reinforcement of the discussed errors. Conclude with a class reflection, where students share their thoughts on the task, encouraging metacognitive awareness regarding their language learning process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use tact and positivity when addressing areas of improvement. Include students in the corrective process by asking questions that encourage self-reflection. Provide alternative phrases for common mistakes, enhancing future language use.             |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins | Utilize this time for additional questions or an impromptu review activity if necessary. Allow students to explore any remaining concerns or misconceptions about esports and competitive gaming. This period can serve as an opportunity for one-on-one support or addressing unexpected challenges that may have arisen during the lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Remain flexible with this time, adapting to student needs as identified during the lesson.
