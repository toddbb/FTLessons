|------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**             | 10 mins    | Begin with a short game called "Two Truths and a Lie" to build rapport. Each student tells the group two true statements and one false statement about their experiences. The others guess which is the lie. This activity encourages students to speak freely and sets a relaxed atmosphere for personal sharing. Using guided examples, the teacher models the activity with personal examples. Pre-teach vocabulary related to talking about personal experiences. Provide sentence starters like "I have...", "I once...". Facilitate peer support by encouraging students to work in pairs first before sharing with the whole group.                                             |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Introduce the topic of interviews and self-presentation. Engage students with a question: "What do you think makes a good first impression in an interview?" Discuss briefly in pairs, then share ideas as a class. Provide a short video clip of a job interview to establish context. Use the clip to identify key elements of self-presentation. Highlight elements like posture, tone, and clarity. Scaffold by pausing the video at critical moments to make observations. Ensure comprehension by asking questions like, "Why is eye contact important?" and encourage students to independently reflect on their own experiences with interviews.            |
| **Present Model**      | 15 mins    | Display a role-play interview dialogue between two characters. Students listen to the dialogue and identify key phrases used for self-introduction and answering questions. The teacher provides a task: Listen for and write down three key phrases used for self-introduction. Use the whiteboard to list these phrases. Model pronunciation and intonation with choral repetition. Provide graphic organizers to map out dialogue structures. Check comprehension with guided questions: "What phrase did they use to talk about their skills?" Encourage students to think critically by discussing the effectiveness of each phrase in pairs.       |
| **Useful Language**    | 15 mins    | Organize an interactive vocabulary quiz using flashcards. Each card has either a term or definition related to interview skills. In pairs, students match terms with definitions or phrases. Use competitive elements by timing the activity. Pre-teach each term using visual aids and example sentences. Facilitate understanding through peer negotiation where students explain terms to each other. Regularly check answers with the class, using formative assessment checkpoints to ensure accuracy. Use sentence frames like "This word means..." to assist students in articulating their guesses. Encourage a playful, energetic atmosphere.      |
| **Preparation**        | 15 mins    | Guide students in preparing their own self-introduction for a mock interview. Use a structured template with prompts ("My name is...", "I have experience in..."). Allow time for students to draft and rehearse individually, encouraging use of new vocabulary. Provide sentence starters and graphic organizers to scaffold their ideas. Circulate in the room offering feedback. Implement peer support frameworks by having students work in pairs to practice introductions. Facilitate feedback through peer observation, ensuring students use language accurately. Encourage creativity and personalization in their introductions.                         |
| **Complete Task**      | 35 mins    | Conduct a mock interview in pairs, where one student is the interviewer and the other is the interviewee. Provide a set of common interview questions for practice. Guide them to switch roles halfway through. Students use their prepared introductions and practice spontaneous responses to questions. Scaffold the task by providing question stems like, "Can you tell me about a time when...?" Encourage fluid interaction by allowing room for follow-up questions. Employ formative assessments by observing and noting areas of strength and improvement. Encourage self-reflection post-interview with questions like, "How did you feel about your answers?"         |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Gather students for group feedback. Highlight general strengths observed during the interviews, such as effective use of vocabulary or clear self-presentation. Address common areas needing improvement, like tense accuracy or pronunciation. Use examples noted from the activity. Utilize peer feedback mechanisms; have students discuss what their partner did well. Offer constructive criticism, focusing on individual performance. Reinforce positive aspects by acknowledging specific details like creative introductions. Encourage a supportive atmosphere where students feel comfortable discussing and receiving feedback openly.                             |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**   | 5 mins     | Allow time to address any additional questions or concerns students have. Provide opportunities for students to ask for clarification on feedback or seek further guidance on task areas they found challenging. Use this time flexibly to review any vocabulary or concepts that need reinforcement. Encourage students to express thoughts on the lesson and ask clarifying questions about future interview scenarios they might encounter, cultivating an atmosphere of open-ended, supportive learning.                                            |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- Encourage students to self-assess and reflect on their progress.
- Monitor pair work closely to provide guidance and support.
- Foster an inclusive environment to lower anxiety during speaking tasks.
- Use differentiation strategies by offering personalized feedback and additional challenges to advanced learners.
