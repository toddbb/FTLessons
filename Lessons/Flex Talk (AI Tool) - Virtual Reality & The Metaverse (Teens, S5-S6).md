|----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins| Begin with a quick game called "Virtual Reality Charades." Students take turns acting out different VR or digital activities without speaking (e.g., playing a VR game, exploring a virtual world). Peers guess the activity. This fun and interactive activity aims to build rapport and introduce the topic in an engaging way. It also lowers affective filters by fostering a supportive environment.                              | Guide students gently if they're struggling to guess, offering hints. Use this time to notice which students naturally lead or need encouragement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins| Start with a short video clip showcasing modern-day applications of VR in business and everyday life. After watching, pose questions to the students about what they saw, such as "How did VR help improve the shopping experience?" or "In what ways is VR changing education?" This helps activate prior knowledge while setting the context. Encourage students to discuss initial impressions in pairs to lower pressure and foster collaboration. | Ensure the video is simple and visually engaging. Monitor pair discussions and offer support by asking guiding questions. Use visual aids, like images from the video, to prompt discussions.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins| Display a reading passage on "The Role of VR in Modern Business." Pair students to read and annotate the passage, highlighting new vocabulary and expressions related to the topic. Students then discuss the content with the partner, focusing on key information such as VR's advantages in business. This stage emphasizes inductive learning by allowing students to discover language in context, promoting a meaningful connection to the material.| Provide sentence starters like “VR can…” or “In businesses, VR might…” to support student discussions. Circulate to answer questions and assess understanding. Scaffold with visual organizers, like concept maps, for students needing extra support.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins| Introduce a vocabulary game called "VR Word Relay." In groups, students are given key vocabulary words related to VR and the metaverse. Each group member must describe a word without using it, as the others guess. Points are awarded for accuracy and creativity. This activity focuses on reinforcing vocabulary knowledge and promoting cooperative learning, as students rely on peer support and teamwork.                               | Pre-teach vocabulary using visual aids and word maps. Model the game with a few words to ensure understanding. Encourage all members to participate by switching roles frequently. Address common pronunciation errors during the activity by modeling correct pronunciation. Regular formative checkpoints through questions ensure understanding and retention.                                                               |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins| Students begin crafting a brief presentation in pairs expressing predictions on future VR applications in daily life and business. They use a preparation sheet with prompts and structure (e.g., introduction, main points, conclusion) to guide their planning. This encourages structured thought and organization before speaking. Gradual release is utilized here, moving from guided to independent production.                                                                                                                                                           | Offer a template and modeling to help with the structuring of ideas. Walk around offering feedback and guiding with additional prompts if needed. Use peer support frameworks, encouraging students to discuss and exchange ideas in their pairs.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins| Students present their ideas to the class. Other students take notes and later ask questions, practicing active listening and speaking skills. The activity emphasizes fluency and confidence, as students speak for extended periods. Create a supportive atmosphere where students feel comfortable expressing opinions. As a teacher, minimize intervention, allowing student autonomy and peer-to-peer learning to dominate.                                    | Encourage supportive peer feedback by providing sentence starters for praise and constructive criticism. Manage time effectively to allow all pairs to present. Check comprehension through formative assessments by asking follow-up questions and eliciting spontaneous interaction.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Conduct a plenary session to discuss common errors noted during presentations related to vocabulary usage or grammatical errors. Use this opportunity to reinforce accurate language use and clear up misconceptions. Students are invited to self-correct, promoting reflection and deeper learning. This stage boosts learners' confidence by acknowledging strengths and addressing language areas with a positive approach, enhancing motivation.                                   | Use a sandwich approach—start with positive feedback, address errors, and end with encouragement. Provide clear examples of accurate language use. Encourage student self-correction by prompting them to reflect on their performance. Highlight language successes to maintain motivation and showcase learning progress.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins | Address any remaining questions, review the vocabulary, or summarize key insights from the lesson. This time can also be used for quick games or energizers if students seem fatigued or to address any spontaneous learning needs that emerged during the lesson.                                                                                                                                                         | Be flexible and responsive to the class atmosphere and energy. Use this time to consolidate learning or introduce supplementary activities if students have mastered the content quicker than anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                   |
