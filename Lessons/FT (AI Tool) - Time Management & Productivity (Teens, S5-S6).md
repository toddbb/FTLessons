| Warmer                     | 10 mins | Begin with a quick game of "Time Keeper". Each student has 30 seconds to talk about what they did before class today. The objective is to not pause for that time. If they succeed, they earn a point. The activity gets students speaking right away and thinking about how they use their time. Pre-emptively, model a 30-second monologue about your own morning to provide a clear example and scaffold expectations. Use sentence starters on the board for support.<br><br>Scaffolding: Teacher models first, providing sentence starters and regular checks. Encourage peer feedback on fluency and coherence using gestures and verbal cues. <br><br>Purpose: Build rapport, activate vocabulary about daily routines, and energize the class. | Keep energy up; focus on quick responses and encourage self-correction if they pause. Use formative checks on fluency and understanding. |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins | Transition to context by showing a short video clip about a busy day at school. Ask students to identify the challenges the person faced due to poor time management. Discuss in pairs and then share responses in a whole-class feedback session. Use graphic organizers on the board to note down challenges and missed opportunities. <br><br>Scaffolding: Set clear objectives for video viewing, use visual aids to support comprehension, and provide key vocabulary. <br><br>Purpose: Set context for lesson, connect to real-world experiences. | Ensure all students grasp the initial video content. Use comprehension checks through questions: "What happened when...?"                |
| Present Model              | 15 mins | Present a model dialogue where two friends discuss a plan for managing their study time more effectively. As students listen, provide them with a worksheet to fill out gaps or answer comprehension questions. After listening, ask comprehension questions about the task and have students role-play the dialogue in pairs. Identify main ideas and expressions used for giving advice. <br><br>Scaffolding: Pre-teach critical vocabulary and sentence structures. Use sentence completion tasks to deepen understanding. <br><br>Purpose: To expose students to target language in context and develop listening skills. | Use peer role-play for practice; reinforce positive usages and clarify misunderstandings in feedback.                                      |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins | Engage the class in a game called "Advice Relay". Students form two teams. Each team writes advice on managing their schoolwork effectively. Begin with a few provided sentence stems such as "You should...", "It's important to...", "Don't forget to...". Use a classroom race format where each student contributes to building a longer piece of advice. Groups share the final pieces, and the class votes on which advice is most practical. <br><br>Scaffolding: Guide the initial rounds, then gradually release responsibility. Provide error correction and support. <br><br>Purpose: To practice forming advice using modal verbs in an engaging format. | Prompt quick transitions between writing and sharing. Use peer-assessment where students identify most effective pieces of advice.        |
| Preparation                | 15 mins | In pairs, students will design a "Productive Day Plan" using a provided template. They will choose specific activities and allocate time slots, utilizing new vocabulary and structures. Encourage using target language when justifying choices. Teachers circulate to provide support. <br><br>Scaffolding: Provide a model plan, use graphic organizers, emphasize the usage of new vocabulary. Offer formative feedback during pair work. <br><br>Purpose: Plan practically using target language and demonstrate understanding of time management strategies. | Encourage clarity in students' plans and input corrections empathetically. Formative feedback should be positive and developmental.        |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins | Students participate in a "Time Management Challenge". In small groups, they must solve a series of scheduling puzzles where they prioritize tasks to complete within a fictional busy day. The group with the most effective schedule wins. Emphasize strategic use of target language to justify their decisions as they present their solutions to the class. <br><br>Scaffolding: Use gradually challenging scenarios, provide prompts for expressing opinions and justifications, use formative assessment for immediate feedback. <br><br>Purpose: To synthesize learning and practice strategic communication. | Observe group interactions to gauge understanding and address misconceptions on-the-spot. Encourage quick, supportive peer-to-peer feedback. |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins | Conduct a wrap-up discussion where students reflect on their learning and teacher provides targeted feedback. Use a "sandwich" technique: positive feedback, followed by constructive insights, ending with encouraging comments. Encourage self-assessment by asking students what they found challenging and strategies to overcome it. <br><br>Scaffolding: Prompt students with sentence starters for reflection, provide clear examples of accurate usage, use positive reinforcement. <br><br>Purpose: Reflect on language use and consolidate strategies. | Personalize feedback to reinforce individual progress. Encourage learners to share group insights to stimulate peer learning.              |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins  | Use any remaining time to address a particular language point that emerged during the lesson that was challenging for many learners. Provide quick revision or fun review games based on classroom needs.<br><br>Purpose: To close any gaps and reinforce learning. | Adapt dynamically based on previous lesson stages.                                                                                 |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiate by providing extra support to students struggling with role-plays by pairing them with stronger peers.
- Be aware of students' difficulty with pronunciation, especially stress on new vocabulary.
- Engage learners with competitive spirit appropriately; ensure games remain inclusive and supportive.
