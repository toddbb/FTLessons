| Warmer                      | 10 mins| Begin by welcoming the students and setting a positive tone for the lesson. Introduce a quick ice-breaker activity called "The Bargaining Game". Give each student three slips of paper with simple negotiation scenarios (e.g., choosing the weekend movie, deciding on a group activity). Students partner up and practice negotiating, aiming for a win-win outcome. Emphasize a supportive atmosphere where students feel comfortable expressing opinions and ideas without judgment.                                | Move around to encourage and offer support. Highlight effective examples for group discussion.         |
| Lead-In / Set Context       | 10 mins| Introduce the main topic by presenting visuals of various negotiation scenarios (e.g., job negotiation, buying groceries, planning a trip). Use guiding questions to activate prior knowledge and discuss the importance of negotiation skills in real life. Encourage students to share personal experiences where they had to negotiate or persuade someone to see the value and relevance of these skills in everyday situations.                                                                                                | Employ visual aids and guide students in connecting with personal experiences to set the context.       |
| Present Model               | 15 mins| Display a short video or audio recording of a negotiation scenario between a customer and a seller. Provide students with a task to listen for specific language cues (e.g., the use of "could" or "should") and identify strategies used by both parties. Follow with a group discussion on the strategies and language observed. Use a visual timeline to sequence the negotiation steps, and allow students to ask questions to deepen their understanding of effective negotiation techniques. | Ensure students have a task while listening to maintain engagement. Encourage active participation.     |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins| Engage students in a role-play card game called "Convince Me". Divide students into small groups and provide a deck of role-play cards with various negotiation contexts. Each student takes turns drawing a card, presenting their scenario, and using provided prompting language structures (e.g., "I propose that...", "Have you considered...") to negotiate. Peers provide feedback on persuasiveness and language use. A quick reflective plenary discussion follows each round to share insights and effective strategies.                                  | Scaffold with sentence starters and encourage peer feedback to support language production.              |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins| Prepare students for a more complex negotiation role-play activity. Students work in pairs as they create a plan for their negotiation task. They brainstorm and outline their goals, persuasive arguments, and possible counterarguments. Teachers provide guidance through formative assessments, allowing students to refine their strategies and language use. Use of graphic organizers is encouraged for structuring ideas logically, ensuring students’ confidence in their planned arguments.                                         | Provide graphic organizers to aid organization. Offer guidance during planning stages and checkpoints.  |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins| Students partake in a comprehensive role-play activity, taking on challenging negotiation scenarios such as planning a group event or deciding on team responsibilities. Encourage students to implement their planned strategies and language while maintaining spontaneity for authentic interaction. Throughout the task, move around to observe and note effective persuasion and negotiating techniques, while ensuring all students are engaged. Following the role-play, groups present their outcomes and reflect on the experience.                                     | Facilitate by offering support and feedback during role-plays. Encourage reflective group discussions.  |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins| Provide targeted feedback on the role-play activities. Praise effective negotiation techniques and language use, while constructively addressing areas for improvement. Use specific examples from students' performances to enhance collective learning. Introduce error correction strategies and encourage self and peer assessment to promote continuous improvement and confidence in negotiation skills. Present a closing reflection question encouraging students to consider future applications of learned skills in real scenarios.                    | Focus on positive reinforcement. Utilize peer assessment to encourage collaborative learning and reflection. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips

- **Differentiation Strategies:** Use mixed ability pairing and provide extra sentence starters for lower-level students.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Encourage students to focus on clarity rather than overusing complex language. Monitor the balance between listening and speaking.
- **Classroom Management:** Ensure clear instructions and provide visual support. Maintain an open, respectful atmosphere for practice.
