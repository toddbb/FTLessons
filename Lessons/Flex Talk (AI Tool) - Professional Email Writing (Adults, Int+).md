|-------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins| Begin by sparking interest with a quick discussion on email usage in professional settings. Ask students if they've ever written a professional email and what they found challenging. Project an amusing image related to email miscommunication to lighten the mood. Encourage students to share any humorous or challenging professional email stories, fostering a relaxed environment conducive to communication and participation.                   | Keep the discussion light-hearted to encourage participation. Use laughter as a tool to lower communication anxiety. Be attentive to students who may not be comfortable sharing and gently encourage them without pressure.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins| Introduce the lesson topic by displaying a formal email sample on the projector. Point out the different sections: subject line, salutation, body, and closing. Discuss why each part is crucial in professional communication. Engage students in identifying the purpose of each section through guided questions, fostering a sense of discovery as they unpack the structure of formal emails collaboratively.                                   | Use a high-contrast, readable email sample. Encourage students to make notes as they evaluate each section. For quieter students, consider grouping them for this activity to foster peer interaction and shared discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins| Show examples of well-written professional emails. Using a think-aloud strategy, guide students through analyzing language choices and tone. Break down the email into sections and discuss how language changes depending on purpose and recipient. Students will then have a task to identify specific language features (e.g., formal greetings) in new email samples, reinforcing awareness through active involvement in identifying critical features.         | Encourage questions as you present. Provide printouts of emails for kinesthetic learners. Use group work to encourage students to verbalize their observations, aiding retention and encouraging peer learning.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins| Engage students in a game-based activity called "Email Bingo". Students receive a bingo card filled with key phrases commonly used in professional emails. As you call out purposes (e.g., requesting information), students find the corresponding phrase on their card. Discuss each correct response to ensure comprehension. This activity gamifies exposure to useful language, enhancing memorability through play and repetition.                          | Ensure understanding by modeling a sample round before the game starts. Use formative assessment by posing questions about why certain phrases are used to reinforce learning. Encourage peer collaboration by having students consult each other if uncertain, fostering a supportive learning atmosphere.                                                                                                 |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins| Students will plan their own professional email. Provide a graphic organizer to help them outline the email’s structure: purpose, recipient, key points, and closing. Allow students to brainstorm in pairs, discussing their ideas and organizing them logically. This collaborative pre-writing stage helps to refine thoughts and gather peer feedback to boost confidence before approaching the writing task.                                            | Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions. Offer sentence starters for students needing additional support. Adjust strategies for students with varying proficiency levels by providing differentiated graphic organizers. Encourage sharing to promote mutual learning and reduce anxiety about content accuracy.                                                                                      |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins| Students write a professional email on a given topic (e.g., applying for a job, requesting information). Allocate time for drafting and revising, encouraging students to focus first on content and structure, followed by proofing for language accuracy. Use peer review by pairing students to exchange emails and provide constructive feedback, emphasizing positive framing while identifying areas for improvement. This activity enhances fluency through practice and reflection. | Provide clear guidelines for peer review to ensure feedback is respectful and constructive. Use a checklist of features to look out for, which helps students focus on specific elements rather than overwhelming them with possibilities. Offer occasional mini-checkpoints for feedback, maintaining student motivation and confidence throughout the task. Encourage independent problem-solving while remaining supportive.            |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins| Provide general feedback based on common errors observed in student emails. Use examples from anonymous drafts to illustrate corrections, ensuring students understand why corrections are necessary. Facilitate a brief discussion on successful strategies used by students in their writing. Encourage self-assessment and peer feedback through guiding questions, reinforcing understanding of lesson content and promoting reflective learning.              | Frame corrections positively to maintain a comfortable atmosphere. Encourage students to self-reflect by asking them to identify what they would improve in their own emails. Offer personalized tips for improvement where possible, catering to individual learning needs.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins | Use this time to address any lingering questions or revisit challenging content. Make adjustments based on students' needs, whether it be extra practice or exploring student interests related to the topic. This flexibility helps ensure no student leaves the class with unclear points, enhancing overall lesson effectiveness and student satisfaction with their learning experience.                                                                  | Be attentive to quieter students who may need encouragement to voice questions. Consider offering this segment as a one-on-one question time for students who may not feel comfortable asking questions in front of the class. Adapt strategies to suit group dynamics, ensuring inclusivity and responsiveness to emerging learning needs.                                                                                      |
