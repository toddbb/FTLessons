### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage**                     | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description** |
|-------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                    | 10 mins    | Begin with a quick icebreaker where students share one thing about their culture in pairs. Encourage them to talk about traditions, food, or festivals. The teacher will circulate, providing vocabulary aids if necessary, ensuring all students are participating and understanding. This encourages a relaxed atmosphere and activates prior cultural knowledge. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**     | 10 mins    | Show a short video clip highlighting diverse cultures around the world. Ask students to note down interesting points. After viewing, pair students to discuss their notes. This activity activates prior cultural knowledge and sets a global context. The teacher will intervene with guided questions to deepen discussions and assess comprehension. |
| **Present Model**             | 15 mins    | Introduce a news article about a global issue. Divide students into groups, assigning each group a different paragraph. They will summarize their sections and teach their peers. The teacher will model how to summarize the beginning paragraph. This scaffolding technique aids comprehension and clarifies expectations while maximizing student engagement and minimizing teacher talk. |
| **Useful Language**           | 15 mins    | Play a vocabulary matching game. Provide students with cards, half with definitions and half with vocabulary words (e.g., diversity, citizenship). Students will walk around matching pairs. After matching, they will form sentences using the vocabulary. The teacher focuses on helping with pronunciation and usage. This interactive setup ensures linguistic engagement and peer support. |
| **Preparation**               | 15 mins    | Students will prepare a short presentation about a cultural aspect of their choice. They will use graphic organizers to plan their presentations, which the teacher will review to provide formative feedback. This preparation balances fluency and accuracy, fostering autonomous language use and thorough planning. |
| **Complete Task**             | 35 mins    | Conduct a "World Fair" where students present their cultural topics. Encourage active listening by organizing a question-and-answer session afterward. The teacher monitors and offers constructive feedback. A minimal teacher-to-student talk ratio is maintained, focusing on student-led discussions. This activity emphasizes real-world application and inter-student communication. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Conduct a feedback session where students reflect on what they learned and enjoyed about the presentations. The teacher collects common errors noted during presentations and writes them on the board for group correction. This error correction fosters a supportive environment where students refine their language skills. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**          | 5 mins     | Address any additional questions or reflections from the students. Optionally, conclude with a discussion about how becoming a global citizen impacts their daily lives. This allows for flexibility and personalized comprehension checks. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Use differentiation strategies such as providing additional visual aids for complex topics.
- Be mindful of the diverse cultural backgrounds of students and create an inclusive environment.
- Prepare for common pitfalls like vocabulary confusion by having visual prompts ready.
