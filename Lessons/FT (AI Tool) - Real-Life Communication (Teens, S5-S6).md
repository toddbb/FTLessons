### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures

| **Stage** | **Timing** | **Detailed Activity Description** | **Instruction Tips** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with an interactive game called "Opinion Corners." Label classroom corners with signs: "Agree," "Disagree," "Neutral," and "Unsure." Present a series of statements related to conflict resolution (e.g., "Compromise is always the best way to resolve a disagreement"). Students move to the corner that represents their opinion and discuss with peers. This activity uses student-centered engagement to activate prior knowledge and get students thinking critically from the onset. Scaffold with pre-teaching necessary vocabulary using flashcards to ensure comprehension. | Monitor group discussions and encourage shy students to express their opinions. Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers to build a comfortable speaking environment. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a brief video clip demonstrating a conflict scenario. Ask students to identify the conflict and brainstorm possible solutions in pairs. After watching, facilitate a group discussion to elicit ideas about what makes communication effective. Use guiding questions to direct students toward the target language. Scaffold with sentence starters on the board. | Use simple comprehension questions to ensure understanding of the video. Offer language frames to support students’ responses. |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Introduce a model dialogue showcasing effective conflict resolution language. Distribute the dialogue script and ask students to identify key phrases used. Read the dialogue aloud, emphasizing stress and intonation for persuasive language. Scaffold with examples and ask comprehension questions to check understanding. Use digital projectors for any inaccessible vocabulary within the script. Incorporate choral repetition for pronunciation practice, followed by pair practice. | Encourage students to annotate the script with intonation markers. Circulate to provide feedback and assistance. Note any difficult pronunciation points for later practice. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Conduct a competitive game called "Phrase Hunt." Distribute sentence strips with conflict resolution phrases. Students race to categorize them under "Suggestions," "Obligations," or "Negotiations" on a large wall chart. Scaffold with quick review and matching exercises to clarify meanings. Victory is achieved through the quickest and most accurate grouping, enhancing the gamified element. Check answers collectively and discuss any misunderstandings. | Reinforce the competitive element while ensuring all students participate. Group students strategically to balance skill levels and encourage peer support. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | Organize students into small groups and provide them with role-play cards depicting various conflict scenarios. Each group prepares a short skit to demonstrate conflict resolution using the target language. Guide students on organizing their dialogues, ensuring authenticity and complexity. Use graphic organizers to help students outline their scenarios. Scaffold through teacher monitoring, offering linguistic structures and phrases as students plan. | Assist with vocabulary and structure as needed, reinforcing respectful and cooperative interaction. Encourage every group member to participate equally in the preparation phase. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Groups perform their skits in front of the class. Encourage audience members to note effective phrases and strategies used, providing a feedback mechanism of peer assessment and critical listening. Facilitate a debrief wherein students share observations and suggest improvements based on the performances. This activity fosters authentic, spontaneous communication and reflective learning. | Maintain a positive atmosphere by celebrating creativity and effort. Encourage constructive feedback, focusing on the use of target language rather than fault-finding. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Provide constructive feedback based on performance observations, focusing on language accuracy and fluency. Use students’ recordings or notes for peer and self-assessment. Reinforce correct language use and highlight improvements. Offer visual aids or corrections charts to address common errors. Scaffold corrections through targeted practice drills (e.g., correcting modal verb use). | Remain supportive and encouraging. Address individual struggles privately if needed. Emphasize group learning through error analysis and shared correction activities. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips  
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger students with those needing more support during discussions to foster peer learning. Use visual aids and technology to reinforce comprehension.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Students may struggle with stress and pronunciation. Address this through consistent practice and encourage self-correction techniques.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain a high level of student engagement by moving quickly between tasks. Use non-verbal signals to manage time effectively and keep transitions smooth.
