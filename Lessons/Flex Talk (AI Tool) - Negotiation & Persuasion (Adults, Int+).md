| Stage                               | Timing  | Extensive Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                          | 10 mins | To establish a welcoming and engaging atmosphere, students begin with a quick “Two Truths and a Lie” activity related to negotiation experiences. In small groups, each student shares two true and one false negotiation or persuasion scenario they’ve faced. Peers guess the lie, promoting speaking fluency. This activity builds rapport and initiates a connection to the lesson topic.                                                                                          | Encourage students to use negotiation-related language. Model the activity with an example before they start. Monitor and provide support as necessary.                   |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**           | 10 mins | Present a short video clip demonstrating a negotiation scenario in a professional setting. Students discuss in pairs what strategies were used and the outcome. Encourage consideration of language cues and body language. Afterwards, facilitate a whole-class discussion to share observations and set the context for the lesson on negotiation and persuasion strategies. This lays the foundation for understanding effective negotiation practices.                       | Use open-ended questions to stimulate discussion. Prompt students to focus on specific language used and non-verbal communication.                                        |
| **Present Model**                   | 15 mins | Introduce a structured dialogue showcasing effective negotiation, projected onto the screen. Students read along while listening to a recording of the dialogue. They work in pairs to identify key phrases and modal verbs used. Highlight how these contribute to persuasive communication. Follow this with an interactive Q&A, where students predict possible negotiation outcomes based on the language used. This reinforces students’ understanding of practical language application.    | Use think-aloud strategies to model the analysis process. Provide students with a guided worksheet focusing on key phrases and language structures.                       |
| **Useful Language**                 | 15 mins | Conduct a game-based activity: a “Negotiation Bingo”. Distribute Bingo cards with key negotiation phrases. As you call out scenarios (e.g., “suggesting a compromise”), students must find and mark the corresponding phrase on their card. The first to complete a row wins. This reinforces phrase recognition through an engaging format. Follow with a brief recap, ensuring understanding and correct usage.                                                            | Clarify Bingo instructions and demonstrate with an example. Encourage students to shout out phrases and provide immediate corrective feedback on their usage.             |
| **Preparation**                     | 15 mins | Students engage in a role-play preparation. In pairs, they choose a scenario card (professional or personal) and plan a negotiation dialogue using a graphic organizer. Prompts guide them to incorporate the discussed phrases and structures. Teacher scaffolds the process, circulating to offer support, correct language use, and provide feedback, ensuring they feel prepared to execute the role-play effectively. This step ensures students systematically integrate learned language. | Provide sentence starters and encourage peer support. Offer formative feedback and check for understanding through quick conversational prompts.                           |
| **Complete Task**                   | 35 mins | Students perform their role-plays in pairs, engaging dynamically with their partner to negotiate and reach mutual agreements. Encourage swapping roles for varied practice. Monitor, providing formative feedback. Post-role-play, students self-reflect on their performance, discussing challenges and successes in small groups. This not only fosters experiential learning but also enhances confidence and fluency in real-life persuasive contexts.               | Minimize teacher talk; facilitate through observation and feedback. Use a checklist to monitor key language use, providing specific congratulatory or corrective feedback. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction**       | 15 mins | Conduct whole-class feedback, highlighting individual and common errors. Address pronunciation, grammar, and body language, using student examples to illustrate points. Facilitate peer feedback, encouraging positive reinforcement and constructive criticism. This ensures students leave with reinforced understanding and confidence in their negotiation and persuasion skills.                                                                 | Use error correction techniques such as recasting and elicitation. Summarize strengths and focus points, allowing students to note personal improvement areas.             |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**                | 5 mins  | Address any emergent questions or revisit challenging sections of the lesson. Alternatively, engage in a spontaneous role-play based on student interest. This ensures all students feel comprehensively supported and concludes the lesson on a positive note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Be adaptable; readiness to adjust based on learner needs is key. Reinforce lesson objectives through quick reinforcement of key concepts or language items misunderstood. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Provide additional support or challenges to cater to varying proficiency levels within the class. Use tiered role-play scenarios.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure clarity in pronunciation of modal verbs. Attend to students who may be overly reliant on scripted language, encouraging spontaneous language use.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain active monitoring, particularly during peer-to-peer activities, to facilitate smooth transitions and ensure all students remain engaged and on-task.
