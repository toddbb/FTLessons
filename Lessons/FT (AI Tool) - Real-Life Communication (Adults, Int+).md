| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 min | Begin with a quick ice-breaker: students form pairs and share a small disagreement they've recently experienced (e.g., choosing a restaurant). Encourage them to speak freely but remind them to keep it brief. Finish with a group discussion where volunteers share one or two stories. This activity leverages peer support and builds rapport. It sets a relaxed tone, enabling students to connect personally with the topic. The teacher monitors and provides support, ensuring all students are engaged and understanding the discussion.                                                                              | Approach students who remain quiet and encourage them to speak. Keep the activity light-hearted to avoid discomfort. Follow-up questions should be open-ended to encourage deeper thinking about the reasons or emotions behind the disagreements shared. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 min | Show a brief video clip (2-3 minutes) of a mediation session. As students watch, they note down examples of language used to resolve the conflict. Engage students in a discussion post-video: what techniques did they observe? This activity employs video as an authentic material to illustrate real-life mediation. Use visual aids and pause the video to clarify language or actions if needed. Allow students to draw connections between observed techniques and their prior experiences. Utilize peer discussion and open the floor for question-raising to ensure comprehension.                                                   | Prepare a list of guiding questions for post-video discussion, such as “What was the mediator’s role?” or “What phrases helped de-escalate the situation?” Insert pauses where necessary to clarify key phrases or actions.                             |
| **Present Model**          | 15 min | Provide students with scenario cards depicting small-scale conflicts or disagreements (e.g., noisy neighbor, unpaid bill). In pairs, students role-play one scenario, with one acting as a mediator. As they role-play, emphasize the use of modal verbs for suggestions. Teacher models a scenario beforehand, demonstrating appropriate language and techniques. This guided practice builds toward independent role play in subsequent activities. Pre-teach vocabulary from the scenario and clarify grammar using examples.                                                                                                              | Ensure the scenarios are relatable. Circulate to offer support, and use formative questions like “What other language could you use there?” to guide student exchanges.                                                                                   |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 min | Transition into a game-based activity, “Language Bingo.” Provide Bingo cards filled with phrases useful in conflict resolution (e.g., “I see your point.”, “What if we…?”, “Let’s look at it from another perspective.”). As students role-play in new pairs using random scenarios, they must use phrases on their Bingo card. When they use a phrase, they cross it off. This activity encourages active use of functional language in a fun and engaging manner, promoting vocabulary retention while allowing peer support.                                                                                                                                  | Emphasize using varied vocabulary by rewarding unique phrases. Monitor, offer praise for the use of target language, and feedback on pronunciation and stress patterns. Clarify any misunderstanding of phrases promptly.                           |
| **Preparation**            | 15 min | In groups, students choose one of the scenarios from earlier and prepare a more detailed role-play, incorporating all elements they’ve practiced. They plan their interactions and script key dialogues to highlight different techniques and language functions. Provide graphic organizers to help them structure their dialogue effectively. Conduct regular formative assessment checks with probing questions, encouraging students to think critically about their mediation strategies.                                                                                                   | Provide sentence starters and feedback during preparation. Encourage groups to consider multiple perspectives by asking questions like “How can you ensure both parties feel heard?” Use a timer to encourage efficient use of preparation time.          |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 min | Students perform their role-plays in their groups, rotating the role of mediator among them. Encourage authentic interaction and spontaneous use of language. Observers provide feedback on the effectiveness of the conflict resolution techniques and language use, supported by a checklist provided earlier. Facilitate this activity smoothly, ensuring every group has time and space. Highlight examples of good practice during a class feedback session.                                                                                                                                                                  | Encourage students to focus on fluency rather than accuracy during performances. Set ground rules for observation feedback to maintain positive reinforcement. Use the checklists for constructive critique. Summarize common strengths and areas for improvement.                     |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 min | Conduct a class debriefing where students reflect on their performances, discussing which techniques and language were most effective. Revisit the language goals, correcting common errors and reinforcing language patterns observed during activities. Use peer feedback to empower learners, highlighting strong performances and language use. Wrap up by highlighting effective mediation strategies noted across performances. Encourage students to self-assess with guiding questions like "What did you learn?" and "How can this be applied outside the classroom?"                                                                                           | Use visual aids like error correction cards to show common language pitfalls. Employ thumbs-up/down for quick feedback checks. Close with positive reinforcement, using specific examples of successful language use noted during observations.             |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 min  | Address any remaining questions or delve deeper into mediation techniques if time allows. Utilize instant feedback from students to tailor a mini-session focusing on unexpected issues or curiosities that arose. This time ensures flexibility and responsive teaching, allowing coverage of elements that may have required additional clarification.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Encourage learning autonomy by asking students what they’d like to delve into further if time permits. Keep this stage adaptable based on students’ needs and energy levels. Highlight key takeaways for consolidation.                              |
