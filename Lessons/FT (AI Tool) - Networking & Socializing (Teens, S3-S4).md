| Stages                     | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Instruction Tips                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                     | 10 mins| The lesson begins with a “Name Chain” game to build rapport. Students sit in a circle. The first student says their name and a hobby (e.g., "I'm Alex, and I like soccer"). The next student repeats the previous student's information and adds their own ("That's Alex, and they like soccer. I'm Mia, and I like reading"). The chain continues around the circle. This activity serves as a fun and interactive way to practice names and interests, ensuring every student speaks and listens attentively. Scaffolding is provided through modeling at the start and offering sentence starters. Formative assessment occurs as the teacher listens and corrects pronunciation or word use as needed. Focus is on creating a relaxed and positive atmosphere. | Ensure students understand the rules before starting. Model the activity with a volunteer to demonstrate how it builds connections through names and interests.  |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Introduce the topic through a brief teacher-led discussion: "Why do people socialize and network? Where do people meet new friends or colleagues?" Use a mind map on the board to collect student responses. This helps activate prior knowledge and set the stage for today's focus on networking and socializing. Vocabulary building is integrated as students mention words related to meeting, introducing, or interacting, which the teacher notes and explains if new. Peer support is encouraged through small group discussions on the same questions, allowing students to share ideas. Regular comprehension checks are done by asking students about their group discussions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Use visuals and prompts on the board to strengthen context setting. Accept various answers to engage all students in the initial discussion.                 |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Using a series of three short video clips that students watch, highlight the art of introductions in different contexts: a business meeting, a school event, and a casual meeting with friends. Each clip is followed by a comprehension task where students answer questions such as "What did the person do first before speaking?" or "How did they introduce themselves?" This task is student-centered as they work in pairs to discuss each scenario. Teacher modeling is provided by going through the first video together, pausing to highlight key language structures and expressions. Sentence starters are provided on the board to assist students with video comprehension tasks.                                                                                                                                                               | Ensure that all students can see and hear the video clearly. Integrate questions that allow students to express personal experiences related to introductions.|
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Implement a "Networking Bingo" game, where each square on the bingo card contains a phrase relevant to networking (e.g., "Nice to meet you," "What do you do?"). Students must circulate, find classmates who can teach them how to use each phrase in context, and fill their bingo cards. This game-based activity reinforces vocabulary and promotes interaction. Teacher circulates to ensure correct usage and offer assistance. Sentence starters and modeled examples on the board aid students in framing their exchanges. Regular formative assessments include teacher observations and quick comprehension checks of appropriate phrase usage. The gradual release of responsibility occurs as students gain confidence using the phrases independently.                                                                                                                                                                  | Prepare bingo cards in advance, considering class size. Encourage shy students by pairing them with supportive peers. Reward the first student who completes their bingo card. |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| Students are placed into small groups and given a specific networking scenario (e.g., meeting a new friend at a club, introducing oneself at a workshop). Each group prepares a short role-play based on their scenario using target vocabulary and phrases from the bingo activity. Teacher scaffolds by offering graphic organizers to help plan their role-play, guiding them through key aspects: opening, middle, and closing interactions. Groups collaborate and practice their role-plays, with ongoing teacher monitoring to offer feedback on pronunciation and vocabulary use. Peer support within groups ensures everyone contributes, and comprehension checks confirm understanding of the task.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Provide structured examples and offer encouragement to ensure all students feel capable of participating. Move around to assist struggling groups as needed.   |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Groups perform their role-plays in front of the class. After each performance, the audience provides feedback, focusing on effectiveness of communication and use of target language. To encourage active listening, students complete a checklist identifying phrases and vocabulary from the bingo activity used during performances. Teacher provides constructive feedback after each presentation, highlighting strengths and offering tips for improvement. Allowing students to perform in groups reduces anxiety and ensures peer collaboration. The task supports gradual release, and student interaction is maximized as they offer constructive criticism using sentence starters like "I liked how you…" or "Next time you could…". Regular formative assessment occurs through peer feedback and teacher notes on performance. | Use a time limit for each role-play to ensure all groups perform. Keep feedback positive, focusing on language use and communication strategies.                  |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Provide a collective feedback session. Begin with a quick anonymous survey where students write down one thing they learned and one challenge they faced during the lesson. Discuss the survey results, highlighting common themes. Follow by addressing common pronunciation or usage errors noted during role-plays. Model correct usage and invite volunteers to practice corrected phrases in context. Encourage students to adopt the I-do, We-do, You-do approach: first modeling correct language, then practicing together, and finally individually applying corrections. Conclude by reinforcing its importance in networking contexts. Scaffold using prompts for self-reflection and encourage peer sharing of tips or strategies.                                                                                                                                                    | Frame feedback positively and ensure all students understand corrections. Reinforce learning with additional examples if necessary.                                        |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)| 5 mins | Use this time to address any unresolved questions or revisit challenging vocabulary. Alternatively, have students share any last thoughts or practice any phrases they enjoyed from the lesson in a casual setting. This flexibility allows the teacher to customize the closing activity based on observed needs throughout the lesson. Encourage peer-to-peer discussions during this time to balance teacher and student talk. Prepare some extra phrases or scenarios in case students need more practice. Focus on goal setting for the next session based on feedback. | Be ready to adapt the flex time based on class mood and energy. Use it for either a brief reflection or revisiting an interesting topic.                                   |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Encourage students to focus on both fluency and accuracy, allowing room for mistakes while promoting self-correction.
- Use differentiation strategies by assigning easier phrases to less confident students and challenging others with complex ones.
- Classroom management: Safeguard a supportive environment where students respect each other during performances and feedback sessions.
- Common pitfalls: Students might struggle with shyness; a gentle push and encouragement for pair or group roles can help ease this.
