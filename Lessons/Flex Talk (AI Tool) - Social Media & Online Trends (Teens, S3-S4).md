| Stage                      | Timing | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                     | 10 mins| To begin, students will engage in a "Social Media Icebreaker" game. Each student writes down their favorite social media platform or influencer on a sticky note. Students then mingle, sticking their note on others’ backs. They must ask yes/no questions to figure out what’s written on their back. This builds rapport and gets students interacting in English. The teacher monitors and provides assistance. Using sentence starters like “Is it...” or “Do they...?” scaffolds student interaction. Afterward, discuss answers as a group.                                                                   |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Introduce the lesson topic by showing a short video of a popular influencer discussing a trending topic. Students watch and make note of any words or phrases they recognize. Discuss the video briefly, asking questions to connect with prior knowledge, such as “Have you seen this trend?” or “Do you know this influencer?”. This activity engages students and activates their background knowledge about social media. Teachers guide through visuals and prompts, checking for comprehension.                                                                                       |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Present students with a dialogue between two friends discussing a new social media trend. The dialogue will be read aloud by the teacher first, with students following along on their handouts. Next, divide students into pairs to practice the dialogue themselves, offering guidance and corrections. Provide sentence starters and visual aids to support comprehension. Use formative checkpoints by asking questions about the dialogue content to ensure students understand the context and the language used.                                                              |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Engage students in a “Trend Talk” game. Create a set of cards with various social media terms and trends. Each student picks a card and explains the term or trend to their partner without saying the word, while the partner guesses it. This game promotes vocabulary retention and understanding. Teacher circulates to assist and provide models as needed. Use visual aids and examples to reinforce vocabulary. Regular feedback is provided, focusing on accurate pronunciation and usage.                                                              |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| Students will create a brief presentation about their favorite online trend or influencer. Using the vocabulary and sentence structures provided, students brainstorm ideas and organize their thoughts using graphic organizers. The teacher models how to structure the presentation using a sample. Peer collaboration is encouraged, allowing students to help each other refine their ideas. Teachers offer guidance by asking scaffolding questions and providing sentence structures.                                                                                                                             |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Students present their topics in small groups, practicing fluency and spontaneous speech. Encourage students to ask questions and give feedback to each other, creating a supportive environment for authentic interaction. The teacher observes, providing immediate corrections and encouragement. This stage emphasizes student engagement, reducing teacher talk to allow maximum student interaction. Feedback focuses on fluency, pronunciation, and use of target vocabulary. This interaction promotes confidence and fluency as students engage with the material.                    |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Conduct a feedback session discussing strengths and areas for improvement. Highlight successful use of language and effective communication strategies observed during presentations. Encourage students to self-reflect on their performance, fostering self-assessment skills. Use error correction techniques like echoing and reformulation to clarify common mistakes. Peer feedback is also integrated, where students give positive feedback and friendly suggestions. This collective discussion helps consolidate language skills and boost confidence.                         |
| Flex-time/Buffer           | 5 mins | Address any remaining questions or areas needing clarification. This time can be used to revisit challenging vocabulary or language structures. Allow students to express any difficulties faced during the lesson, providing personalized guidance as needed. This flexibility ensures that all learning objectives are fully met by adapting swiftly to emergent needs, supporting overall comprehension and retention. Students can also use this time to share a final funny or interesting social media fact they know, fostering a lighthearted wrap-up.                                      |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- Differentiate activities by providing additional scaffolding to students needing support, such as sentence frames or visual aids.
- Be attentive to students who might be shy or reluctant to speak, offering positive reinforcement and encouragement.
- Ensure digital resources are functional before the lesson and consider technical issues that may arise.
