| Stages                      | Timing  | Detailed Activity Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Instruction Tips                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmer                      | 10 mins | Begin with a simple negotiation game: "Trading Up". Each student starts with a paperclip and has five minutes to negotiate trades with classmates to see who can end up with the most valuable item. This activity breaks the ice, encourages interaction, and sets the context for negotiation. Monitor students and note natural language usage. | Encourage all students to engage. Use phrases like "What would you like for your paperclip?" to guide them.     |
| Lead-In / Set Context       | 10 mins | Show a short video clip of a simple negotiation scenario, such as ordering pizza and sharing preferences. After the clip, ask students to identify key phrases and general strategies used. Discuss briefly as a class to activate prior knowledge and spark interest in negotiation contexts.                                              | Pause video after key moments for students to discuss. Use visuals and prompts to help students recall phrases. |
| Present Model               | 15 mins | Introduce a model dialogue involving negotiation, such as negotiating chores at home. Distribute handouts with the dialogue text. Students read along as they listen, noting phrases and expressions. Then, they'll answer comprehension questions about the dialogue to ensure understanding of negotiation dynamics.                           | Highlight key expressions. Use think-aloud strategies to model thought processes behind negotiation moves.      |
| Useful Language             | 15 mins | Play a "Persuasive Phrase Bingo" game. Provide students with bingo cards filled with useful negotiation and persuasion phrases. As you call out phrases, students must listen and mark their cards. Upon getting a bingo, students must use each phrase marked in original sentences related to negotiating a weekend trip.                    | Focus on irregular phrases. Provide example sentences to scaffold usage. Encourage peer correction.             |
| Preparation                 | 15 mins | Students prepare for a role-play activity where they negotiate a plan for a school event. In pairs, they brainstorm ideas, decide roles, and plan their arguments. Provide graphic organizers to help structure their ideas. This preparation balances language accuracy with fluency and allows for peer support.                              | Offer feedback on their plans. Use graphic organizers for clarity in argument structure.                        |
| Complete Task               | 35 mins | Conduct the role-play activity. Each pair presents their negotiation regarding the school event to another pair, who observes and evaluates persuasion effectiveness. Afterward, groups switch roles. Provide formative assessment checkpoints through observation and feedback sessions, focusing on both positive language use and areas for improvement. | Keep rotations fast-paced. Provide positive reinforcement. Use clear criteria for peer evaluations.             |
| Feedback/Error Correction   | 15 mins | Gather the class and provide collective feedback based on observed performances, addressing common errors and exemplary usage. Encourage students to self-reflect on their negotiations. Model correct language forms where necessary and engage students in a brief peer-correction activity. Give both group and individual feedback to nurture confidence and encourage improvement.                                     | Focus on constructive feedback. Use examples from the lesson. Create an open, supportive atmosphere.             |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional) | 5 mins  | Use this time to wrap up any ongoing discussions, address additional questions about the topic, or incorporate additional practice for specific pairs if needed.                                                                                                                              | Be adaptive to emerging needs. Offer additional resources or clarification if required.                         |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
- Prioritize student-centered learning; facilitate rather than dominate discussions.
- Use visual aids and audiotapes to support auditory and visual learners.
- Differentiate by providing extra support or extension tasks for varied learner speeds, ensuring all students remain engaged.
