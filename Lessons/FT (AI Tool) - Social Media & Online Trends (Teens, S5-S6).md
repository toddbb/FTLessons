| Warmer                     | 10 mins| Begin with a quick game of “Word Association” related to social media. Students sit in a circle, and one starts with a social media word (e.g., "hashtag"), the next follows with one connected to it (e.g., "trend"). This circles around, building energy and relevant vocabulary exploration, getting students into the mindset for today's topic. The lighthearted atmosphere encourages participation and rapport.                                | Encourage quick responses without long pauses. Use a timer to keep the pace snappy. Provide some starter words if students struggle to get started. Highlight interesting connections between words. Keep teacher talk minimal; facilitate only as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Show images of popular social media icons and influencers. Elicit thoughts and elicit responses like "Which platforms do you use?" or "Who is your favorite influencer?" Follow with a brief discussion of recent online trends. Use a Think-Pair-Share strategy for students to discuss with a partner before sharing with the class. This scaffolds the conversation by lowering individual pressure and building peer support.                                       | Use images to anchor conversation and enhance understanding. Pre-teach key vocabulary using visuals from Handout 1. Limit teacher talk to essential questions to facilitate exploration. Monitor pairs for engagement and understanding, offering prompts or rephrased questions if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Introduce a short video or article on a current social media trend or influencer. Students watch or read while completing a short worksheet (Handout 2) with comprehension questions. This task encourages active listening/reading and provides contextualized language examples. Post-model, have students discuss their answers in pairs, fostering deeper comprehension through peer clarification.                                                                   | Select an engaging, age-appropriate video/article. Model comprehension strategy: preview questions, note-taking hints. Keep the material challenging but accessible. Circulate during pair work to provide support. Maintain focus on student interaction over teacher lecture to construct understanding collaboratively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Engage students in a board game based on expressing opinions about social media (Handout 3). The board includes spaces that prompt discussion (e.g., "Share a trend you loved," "Talk about influencer impact on teens"). In teams, students roll dice and move, engaging with prompts where they land. Provide sentence starters to scaffold expressions: "I think that...", "In my opinion...", "I agree/disagree because...".                                      | Group students strategically to maximize interaction. Review prompt cards and sentence starters before starting the game, clarifying usage. Encourage use of newly introduced vocabulary, providing gentle correction as needed. Use formative assessment to gauge speaking confidence and accuracy, noting any recurring errors for post-activity feedback. Maintain a lively pace to keep engagement high.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| Have students plan a short speech or dialogue about their chosen trend or influencer, using a graphic organizer provided (Handout 4). They outline key points, vocabulary to use, and any expressions for arguing their view. Peer pairs offer suggestions, refining ideas collaboratively. This peer-supported planning ensures a balance between fluency and accuracy before practice.                                                                                         | Introduce the graphic organizer with a clear example. Emphasize the importance of structure using a clear modeled sample. Coach students to support each other constructively. Offer input on diversifying vocabulary and enhancing arguments. Minimize direct involvement, allowing students primary control over content. This encourages the gradual release of responsibility. Use this time to prepare attentive observation for the following task.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Students participate in a role-play debate on a given topic (“Are influencers positive role models?”). Working in groups, students assume roles (for/against) and present arguments using prepared notes. Encourage active listening and dynamic interaction. Support by adding twists or new evidence to challenge arguments midway. This task solidifies language in a fluent context while developing critical thinking.                                                                | Structure roles clearly to provide balanced participation opportunities. Encourage dynamic speaking, offering praise for clear arguments and well-used vocabulary. Provide intervention minimally, allowing natural development of the discussion. Use prompted questions if the debate stalls. Engage quieter students by redirecting questions or summarizing key points to reignite dialogue. The dynamic element aims to engage students, reinforcing speaking under real-speaking conditions. Record participation quality/quantity to inform the following feedback session.                                                                  |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Facilitate feedback focusing on content and language use. Highlight strong points and common errors noted during the debate. Use examples to demonstrate adjustments. Encourage students to self-reflect on their contributions and peer-feedback observations. This stage reinforces accurate language use and strategic improvements in discussions. ended if needed.                                                                                                                         | Provide feedback that is specific and balanced (positive/constructive). Initiate self-assessment by asking students about their perceived strengths and weaknesses. Use language-related errors to reinforce correct usage. Avoid excessive correction; focus on key takeaway points to prevent overload. Provide supplemental exercises targeting highlighted errors if learning gaps emerge.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)| 5 mins | Address emergent questions or provide additional clarification based on need, using pre-prepared additional materials or content based on immediate observational data from today's lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Utilize this time flexibly, addressing any urgent or notable student needs. Use this session to also reflect on the lesson’s success in achieving set objectives with students, fostering metacognitive skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Teacher Notes and Tips
