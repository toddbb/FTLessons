### Step-by-Step Lesson Procedures:

| Stage | Timing | Detailed Activity Description |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Warmer** | 10 mins | Begin with a quick icebreaker game called "Agree or Disagree". The teacher presents several statements about common topics (e.g., "Social media does more harm than good") and students move to different sides of the room indicating "Agree" or "Disagree". Encourage a few students to explain their choice in one sentence. This activity activates prior knowledge and sets a lively tone. The teacher may provide sentence starters like “I agree/disagree because…”. Use formative assessment by asking follow-up questions to check understanding. |
| **Lead-In / Set Context** | 10 mins | Show a short video clip of a friendly debate from a popular educational show. Pause after key arguments and facilitate a brief discussion on the strategies used. Ask students to note specific words or phrases that highlight persuasive techniques. This will prime them for the kind of language they’ll be using. Engage students with prompts, e.g., “What words did they use to introduce their opinions?” |
| **Present Model** | 15 mins | Present a sample debate on whether homework should be banned. Use a handout with a transcript, visually highlighting linking words and persuasive structures. Students work in pairs to identify these elements in the text. Model the process first by demonstrating how to underline and annotate a few examples. Check answers as a group, reinforcing the correct usage and meaning of each highlighted element. |
| **Useful Language** | 15 mins | Conduct a role-play card game called "Argument Swap". Each pair receives a set of cards with argument prompts and responses. They take turns presenting a point and responding to their partner, using linking phrases like "on the other hand" or "in conclusion". Instructor circulates, providing feedback and corrections, ensuring minimal teacher talk by encouraging students to self-correct and support each other. |
| **Preparation** | 15 mins | Students brainstorm arguments for a class debate using a graphic organizer. Each group selects a topic and organizes their viewpoints, counterarguments, and supporting details. Teacher models an example then scaffolds the process through guided questions and examples. This allows students to prepare structured arguments and think critically about their content. |
| **Complete Task** | 35 mins | Divide class into two teams for a formal debate. Topics are randomly assigned. Each team has an opening statement phase, rebuttal, and conclusion. During the debate, students sustain interaction with minimum teacher interference. Facilitate peer assessment by having students note strengths and areas for improvement in their classmates’ delivery, later discussed in feedback. |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins | Conduct a feedback session. Begin with positive comments, highlighting effective use of language and persuasive techniques. Use anonymized examples from the debate to gently correct common errors. Encourage self- and peer-reflection by asking students to identify one way they improved and one area for future focus. Utilize formative feedback strategies to support learner autonomy and improvement. |
| **Flex-time/Buffer (Optional)** | 5 mins | Address any emergent language needs or revisit key concepts if necessary. Use this time to clarify doubts or practice difficult phrases, ensuring all students feel confident before concluding the session. |

### Teacher Notes and Tips:
- **Differentiation Strategies:** Pair stronger and weaker students to offer peer support. Provide additional sentence starters or language prompts for students needing more assistance.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ensure students avoid reading directly from notes during debates, encouraging natural speaking and interaction. 
- **Classroom Management:** Establish clear debate guidelines and time limits to maintain focus and fairness.
