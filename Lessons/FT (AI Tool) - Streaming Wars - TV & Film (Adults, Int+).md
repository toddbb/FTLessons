|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warmer**                 | 10 mins    | Students engage in a quick icebreaker game of "Two Truths and a Lie" about their favorite TV shows or films. Students share three statements: two true, one false. Peers guess the false one, promoting discussion and setting a light-hearted tone. | Guide students to use the Present Perfect for experiences. Encourage sharing details to make the activity engaging.                                                     |
| **Lead-In / Set Context**  | 10 mins    | Show a short, engaging video clip highlighting the evolution of media consumption, from traditional TV to streaming services. Following the video, discuss initial impressions and questions in pairs. Each pair shares a thought with the class, setting the context for streaming services. | Ensure the clip is visually appealing, and provide guiding questions to focus discussion. Allow students to express thoughts freely.                                    |
| **Present Model**          | 15 mins    | Introduce an infographics article comparing streaming services and traditional media. Students are tasked to skim the content and identify key differences between the two. Students then share findings in small groups, focusing on understanding various impacts. | Provide sentence starters and highlight useful language during group discussions. Use visual aids to enhance understanding.                                              |
| **Useful Language**        | 15 mins    | Conduct a vocabulary game, "Taboo," where students describe terms related to streaming without using specific taboo words. Terms include "binge-watch," "subscriber," and "on-demand." Peers guess using context clues. This interactive game reinforces vocabulary in a fun, competitive way. | Pre-teach essential vocabulary and model how to play "Taboo." Provide examples and practice rounds. Use visual aids to explain less familiar terms.                      |
| **Preparation**            | 15 mins    | Students prepare a short presentation comparing traditional and modern media consumption. In pairs, they brainstorm the pros and cons using a graphic organizer. This structured activity fosters critical thinking about media trends. | Scaffold preparation with sentence frames and guiding questions. Monitor pairs to provide support and ensure equal participation.                                       |
| **Complete Task**          | 35 mins    | Students present their comparative analysis to the class, followed by a group discussion. Encourage learners to ask questions and challenge each other's ideas. The focus is on speaking fluency, opinion expression, and interactive dialogue. | Encourage clarity and structured arguments. Facilitate peer feedback with sentence starters like "I agree because..." or "What do you mean by...?"                      |
| **Feedback/Error Correction** | 15 mins    | Provide constructive feedback focusing on vocabulary use, grammar accuracy, and overall fluency. Highlight successful communication strategies and areas for improvement. Use examples from student presentations to contextualize feedback. | Focus on positive reinforcement and specific areas of improvement. Provide corrective feedback gently, emphasizing development and confidence-building.                   |
| **Flex-time/Buffer**       | 5 mins     | Open the floor for any emergent questions or discussions on media consumption trends. Use any extra time for additional practice or clarification on vocabulary or concepts discussed. | Be attentive to student needs for further clarification or interest-driven tangents. Tailor flex-time to address emergent learning gaps or curiosities.                  |

### Teacher Notes and Tips
- Differentiate by providing additional vocabulary support or sentence frames for varying proficiency levels.
- Monitor to ensure a low teacher-to-student talk ratio; facilitate rather than dominate discussions.
- Watch for common pitfalls in pronunciation of new terms, offering corrective support as needed.
