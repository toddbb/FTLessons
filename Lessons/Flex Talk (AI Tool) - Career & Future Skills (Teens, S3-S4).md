| Warmer                     | 10 mins| Begin with a circle activity where students say their name and one job they think is interesting. Encourage students to use their imagination and share dreams confidently. Support this by showing images of various professions to stimulate interest. This activity activates prior knowledge and builds a relaxed environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Provide sentence starters like "I am... and I think... job is interesting because..." |
| Lead-In / Set Context      | 10 mins| Introduce the topic of careers and future skills by playing a quick game of "Guess the Job". Show students flashcards with images of different jobs. Students must guess the job by asking yes/no questions. For example, "Do they work outside?", "Do they wear a uniform?" This engages students and sets the context. Use this opportunity to pre-teach key vocabulary related to various careers and some essential questions they can ask.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Demonstrate one example with the whole group before starting.                          |
| Present Model              | 15 mins| Play an audio recording of a short conversation between two people discussing their career plans and future skills. Provide students with a task to listen for specific information, such as what jobs each person mentions and any future skill they want to learn. After listening, have students pair up to compare their answers. This stage allows students to identify models of conversation and recycle vocabulary encountered. Follow it up with comprehension checks for understanding and clarify any unknown vocabulary or expressions used in the conversation.                                                           | Monitor pairs to ensure understanding and provide necessary supports like transcripts if needed.  |
| Useful Language            | 15 mins| Transition into a vocabulary practice game called "Career Bingo". Provide students with bingo cards filled with career-related terms. As you call out words, have students mark them on their cards. Use this time to drill the pronunciation and clarify meanings of any difficult words. Integrate peer teaching by allowing students to explain meanings to each other. The game-like atmosphere promotes engagement, while the familiar format ensures a focus on the key terms being learned. After a round, have students call out examples sentences using the words. This ensures functional usage. | Offer linguistic scaffolding through modeling sentences like, "A doctor will help sick people."  |
| Preparation                | 15 mins| Facilitate a brainstorming activity where students think about what job they might like to do in the future. Provide a graphic organizer to help them outline the skills needed for their chosen career and how these might be developed. Encourage collaboration in pairs to support each other in expanding ideas and using new vocabulary. The format enables them to systemically plan their concepts, promoting both language usage and critical thinking. Regularly check for understanding and correct any language errors, focusing on both future simple structures and correct vocabulary usage.                                       | Provide sentence starters like, "I would like to be... because... I will need skills like..."  |
| Complete Task              | 35 mins| Engage students in a role-play scenario where they act as interviewers and candidates discussing future career plans. Provide cards with interview questions focusing on future skills and career preferences. Students work in pairs, alternating roles. This task enhances fluence in using the target language and structures in meaningful contexts. Students should ask and answer using the vocabulary and language structures practiced. Monitor and give feedback throughout, focusing on correct usage and intonation. Have pairs share highlights with the class to encourage sharing and comment respectfully.                          | Scaffold by modeling an interview exchange and utilizing gestures and visual aids for support. |
| Feedback/Error Correction  | 15 mins| Reflect on the role-play activity by eliciting feedback from students about their experience. Use this opportunity to correct persistent errors heard during the task, focusing on vocabulary inaccuracies and sentence structure. Encourage positive peer reviews to enhance confidence and mutual learning. Engage students in a brief discussion about what future skills might be necessary for the jobs discussed. Acknowledge successful use of the language and provide suggestions for further improvement.                                                                                                                                    | Validate the students' experiences and emphasize improvement over perfection.            |
| Flex-time/Buffer            | 5 mins | Use this time to address any questions from students or clarify difficult vocabulary. If the class has accomplished the lesson faster than expected, introduce a mini-game on future skills trends using interactive digital quizzes. These quizzes can reinforce understanding and provide a fun close to the session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Keep interaction student-centered and maintain excitement till the end.                   |
